Built on the former Railway Lands, it was completed in 1976, and held the record for the world's tallest free-standing structure for 32 years from 1975–2007 and was the world's tallest tower until 2009 being overtaken by Burj Khalifa and Canton Tower, respectively. It is now the third tallest tower in the world and remains the tallest free-standing structure in the Western Hemisphere, a signature icon of Toronto's skyline, and a symbol of Canada, attracting more than two million international visitors annually.\n\nIts name \"CN\" originally referred to Canadian National, the railway company that built the tower. Following the railway's decision to divest non-core freight railway assets, prior to the company's privatization in 1995, it transferred the tower to the Canada Lands Company, a federal Crown corporation responsible for real estate development. Since the name \"CN Tower\" became common in daily usage, the abbreviation was eventually expanded to Canadian National Tower or Canada's National Tower. However, neither of these names is commonly used.\n\nIn 1995, the CN Tower was declared one of the modern Seven Wonders of the World by the American Society of Civil Engineers. It also belongs to the World Federation of Great Towers.\n\nThe idea of the CN Tower originated in 1968 when the Canadian National Railway wanted to build a large TV and radio communication platform to serve the Toronto area, as well as demonstrate the strength of Canadian industry and CN in particular. These plans evolved over the next few years, and the project became official in 1972.\n\nThe tower would have been part of Metro Centre (see CityPlace), a large development south of Front Street on the Railway Lands, a large railway switching yard that was being made redundant by newer yards outside the city. Key project team members were NCK Engineering as structural engineer; John Andrews Architects; Webb, Zerafa, Menkes, Housden Architects; Foundation Building Construction; and Canron (Eastern Structural Division).\n\nAs Toronto grew rapidly during the late 1960s and early 1970s, multiple skyscrapers were constructed in the downtown core, most notably First Canadian Place. The reflective nature of the new buildings compromised the quality of broadcast signals necessitating new, higher antennas that were at least tall.\n\nAt the time, most data communications took place over point-to-point microwave links, whose dish antennae covered the roofs of large buildings. As each new skyscraper was added to the downtown, former line-of-sight links were no longer possible. CN intended to rent \"hub\" space for microwave links, visible from almost any building in the Toronto area.\n\nThe CN Tower can be seen from at least as far away as Kennedy Street in Aurora, Ontario, approximately to the north, east of Toronto, in Oshawa, and from several points on the south shore of Lake Ontario, to the south in the U.S. state of New York.\n\nThe original plan for the tower envisioned a tripod consisting of three independent cylindrical \"pillars\" linked at various heights by structural bridges. Had it been built, this design would have been considerably shorter, with the metal antenna located roughly where the concrete section between the main level and the SkyPod lies today. As the design effort continued, it evolved into the current design with a single continuous hexagonal core to the SkyPod, with three support legs blended into the hexagon below the main level, forming a large Y-shape structure at the ground level.\n\nThe idea for the main level in its current form evolved around this time, but the Space Deck (now named SkyPod) was not part of the plans until some time later. One engineer in particular felt that visitors would feel the higher observation deck would be worth paying extra for, and the costs in terms of construction were not prohibitive. It was also some time around this point that it was realized that the tower could become the world's tallest structure, and plans were changed to incorporate subtle modifications throughout the structure to this end.\n\nConstruction on the CN Tower began on February 6, 1973, with massive excavations at the tower base for the foundation. By the time the foundation was complete, of earth and shale were removed to a depth of in the centre, and a base incorporating of concrete with of rebar and of steel cable had been built to a thickness of . This portion of the construction was fairly rapid, with only four months needed between the start and the foundation being ready for construction on top.\n\nTo build the main support pillar, a hydraulically raised slipform was built at the base. This was a fairly impressive engineering feat on its own, consisting of a large metal platform that raised itself on jacks at about per day as the concrete below set. Concrete was poured continuously by a team of 1,532 people until February 22, 1974, during which it had already become the tallest structure in Canada, surpassing the recently built Inco Superstack in Sudbury, which was built using similar methods.\n\nIn total, the tower contains of concrete, all of which was mixed on-site in order to ensure batch consistency. Through the pour, the vertical accuracy of the tower was maintained by comparing the slip form's location to massive plumb bobs hanging from it, observed by small telescopes from the ground. Over the height of the tower, it varies from true vertical accuracy by only .\nIn August 1974, construction of the main level commenced. Using 45 hydraulic jacks attached to cables strung from a temporary steel crown anchored to the top of the tower, twelve giant steel and wooden bracket forms were slowly raised, ultimately taking about a week to crawl up to their final position. These forms were used to create the brackets that support the main level, as well as a base for the construction of the main level itself. The Space Deck (currently named SkyPod) was built of concrete poured into a wooden frame attached to rebar at the lower level deck, and then reinforced with a large steel compression band around the outside.\n\nThe antenna was originally to be raised by crane as well, but during construction the Sikorsky S-64 Skycrane helicopter became available when the United States Army sold off theirs to civilian operators. The helicopter, named \"Olga\", was first used to remove the crane, and then flew the antenna up in 36 sections.\n\nThe flights of the antenna pieces were a minor tourist attraction of their own, and the schedule was printed in the local newspapers. Use of the helicopter saved months of construction time, with this phase taking only three and a half weeks instead of the planned six months. The tower was topped off on April 2, 1975, after 26 months of construction, officially capturing the height record from Moscow's Ostankino Tower, and bringing the total mass to .\n\nTwo years into the construction, plans for Metro Centre were scrapped, leaving the tower isolated on the Railway Lands in what was then a largely abandoned light-industrial space. This caused serious problems for tourists to access the tower. Ned Baldwin, project architect with John Andrews, wrote at the time that \"All of the logic which dictated the design of the lower accommodation has been upset,\" and that \"Under such ludicrous circumstances Canadian National would hardly have chosen this location to build.\"\n\nThe CN Tower opened to the public on June 26, 1976. The construction costs of approximately ($ in dollars) were repaid in fifteen years. Canadian National Railway sold the tower prior to taking the company private in 1995, when they decided to divest themselves of all operations not directly related to their core freight shipping businesses.\n\nFrom the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s, the CN Tower was practically the only development along Front Street West; it was still possible to see Lake Ontario from the foot of the CN Tower due to the expansive parking lots and lack of development in the area at the time. As the area around the tower was developed, particularly with the completion of the Metro Toronto Convention Centre in 1984 and the SkyDome in 1989 (renamed Rogers Centre in 2005), the former Railway Lands were redeveloped and the tower became the centre of a newly developing entertainment area. Access was greatly improved with the construction of the SkyWalk in 1989, which connected the tower and SkyDome to the nearby Union Station railway and subway station, and, in turn, to the city's PATH underground pedestrian system. By the mid-1990s, it was the centre of a thriving tourist district. The entire area continues to be an area of intense building, notably a boom in condominium construction in the first two decades of the 21st century, as well as the 2013 opening of the Ripley's Aquarium by the base of the tower.\n\n\nThe CN Tower consists of several substructures. The main portion of the tower is a hollow concrete hexagonal pillar containing the stairwells and power and plumbing connections. The Tower's six elevators are located in the three inverted angles created by the Tower's hexagonal shape (two elevators per angle). Each of the three elevator shafts is lined with glass, allowing for views of the city as the glass-windowed elevators make their way up the Tower. The stairwell was originally located in one of these angles (the one facing north), but was moved into the central hollow of the Tower; the Tower's new fifth and sixth elevators were placed in the hexagonal angle that once contained the stairwell. On top of the main concrete portion of the Tower is a tall metal broadcast antenna, carrying TV and radio signals. There are three visitor areas: the Glass Floor and Outdoor Observation Terrace which are both located at an elevation of , the Indoor Lookout Level (formerly known as \"Indoor Observation Level\") located at , and the higher SkyPod (formerly known as \"Space Deck\") at , just below the metal antenna. The hexagonal shape can be seen between the two areas; however, below the main deck, three large supporting legs give the tower the appearance of a large tripod.\n\nThe main deck level is seven storeys, some of which are open to the public. Below the public areas — at — is a large white donut-shaped radome containing the structure's microwave receivers. The glass floor and outdoor observation deck are at . The glass floor has an area of and can withstand a pressure of . The floor's thermal glass units are thick, consisting of a pane of laminated glass, airspace and a pane of laminated glass. Some people experience acrophobia when standing on the glass floor and looking down at the ground below. In 2008, one elevator was upgraded to add a glass floor panel, believed to have the highest vertical rise of any elevator equipped with this feature. The Horizons Cafe and the lookout level are at . The 360 Restaurant, a revolving restaurant that completes a full rotation once every 72 minutes, is at . When the tower first opened, it also featured a disco named Sparkles (at the Indoor Observation Level), billed as the highest disco and dance floor in the world.\n\nThe SkyPod was once the highest public observation deck in the world until it was surpassed by the Shanghai World Financial Center in 2008.\n\nA metal staircase reaches the main deck level after 1,776 steps, and the SkyPod above after 2,579 steps; it is the tallest metal staircase on Earth. These stairs are intended for emergency use only and are not open to the public, except for two times per year for charity stair-climb events. The average climber takes approximately 30 minutes to climb to the base of the radome, but the fastest climb on record is 7 minutes and 52 seconds in 1989 by Brendan Keenoy, an Ontario Provincial Police officer. In 2002, Canadian Olympian and Paralympic champion Jeff Adams climbed the stairs of the tower in a specially designed wheelchair. The stairs were originally on one of the three sides of the tower (facing north), with a glass view, but these were later replaced with the third elevator pair and the stairs were moved to the inside of the core. Top climbs on the new, windowless stairwell used since around 2003 have generally been over ten minutes.\n\nOn August 1, 2011, the CN Tower opened the EdgeWalk, an amusement in which thrill-seekers can walk on and around the roof of the main pod of the tower at , which is directly above the 360 Restaurant. It is the world's highest full-circle, hands-free walk. Visitors are tethered to an overhead rail system and walk around the edge of the CN Tower's main pod above the 360 Restaurant on a metal floor. The attraction is closed throughout the winter season and during periods of electrical storms and high winds.\n\nOne of the notable guests who visited EdgeWalk includes comedian Rick Mercer, as featured on his CBC Television show, \"Rick Mercer Report\".\n\nA freezing rain storm on March 2, 2007, resulted in a layer of ice several centimetres thick forming on the side of the tower and other downtown buildings. The sun thawed the ice, and winds of up to blew some of it away from the structure. There were fears that cars and windows of nearby buildings would be smashed by large chunks of ice. In response, police closed some streets surrounding the tower. During morning rush hour on March 5 of the same year, police expanded the area of closed streets to include the Gardiner Expressway away from the tower, as increased winds blew the ice farther away, as far north as King Street, away, where a taxicab window was shattered.\n\nSubsequently, on March 6, 2007, the Gardiner Expressway was reopened after winds died down.\n\nIn August 2000, a fire broke out at the Ostankino Tower in Moscow. It killed three people and caused extensive damage. The fire was blamed on poor maintenance and outdated equipment. The failure of the fire-suppression systems and the lack of proper equipment for firefighters allowed the fire to destroy most of the interior and spark fears the tower might even collapse.\n\nThe Ostankino Tower was completed nine years before the CN Tower, and is only shorter. The parallels between the towers led to some concern that the CN Tower could be at risk of a similar tragedy. However, Canadian officials subsequently stated that it is \"highly unlikely\" that a similar disaster could occur at the CN Tower, as it has important safeguards that were not present in the Ostankino Tower. Specifically, officials cited:\n\n\nOfficials also noted that the CN Tower has an excellent safety record, although there was an electrical fire in the antennae on August 16, 2017 — the tower's first fire. Moreover, other supertall structures built between 1967 and 1976 — such as the Willis Tower (formerly the Sears Tower), the World Trade Center (until its destruction on September 11, 2001), the Fernsehturm Berlin, the Aon Center, the John Hancock Center, and First Canadian Place — also have excellent safety records, which suggests that the Ostankino Tower accident was a rare safety failure, and that the likelihood of similar events occurring at other supertall structures is extremely low.\n\nThe CN Tower was originally lit at night with incandescent lights, but they were removed in 1997, because they were inefficient and expensive to repair. In June 2007, the tower was outfitted with 1,330 super-bright LED lights inside the elevator shafts, shooting up over the main pod and upward to the top of the tower's mast to light the tower from dusk until 2 a.m. The official opening ceremony took place on June 28 before the Canada Day holiday weekend.\n\nThe tower changes its lighting scheme on holidays and to commemorate major events. After the 95th Grey Cup in Toronto, the tower was lit up in green and white to represent the colours of the Grey Cup champion Saskatchewan Roughriders. From sundown on August 27, 2011, to sunrise the following day, the tower was lit in orange, the official colour of the New Democratic Party (NDP), to commemorate the death of federal NDP leader and leader of the official opposition Jack Layton. When former South African president Nelson Mandela died, the tower was lit up in the colours of the South African flag. When former federal finance minister under Stephen Harper's Conservatives Jim Flaherty died, the tower was lit in green to reflect his Irish Canadian heritage. On the night of the attacks on Paris on November 13, 2015, the CN Tower was lit up in the colours of the French flag.\n\nProgrammed from a desktop computer with a wireless network interface controller in Burlington, Ontario, the LEDs use less energy to light than the previously used incandescent lights (10% less energy than the dimly lit version and 60% less than the brightly lit version). The estimated cost to use the LEDs is $1,000 per month.\n\nDuring the spring and autumn bird migration seasons, the lights would be turned off to comply with the voluntary Fatal Light Awareness Program, which \"encourages buildings to dim unnecessary exterior lighting to mitigate bird mortality during spring and summer migration.\"\n\nThe CN Tower is the tallest freestanding structure in the Western Hemisphere. As of 2013, there are only two other freestanding structures in the Western Hemisphere which exceed in height; the Willis Tower in Chicago, which stands at when measured to its pinnacle; and the topped-out One World Trade Center in New York City, which has a pinnacle height of , or approximately shorter than the CN Tower. Due to the symbolism of the number 1776 (the year of the signing of the United States Declaration of Independence), the height of One World Trade Center is unlikely to be increased. The proposed Chicago Spire was expected to exceed the height of the CN Tower, but its construction was halted early due to financial difficulties amid the Great Recession, and was eventually cancelled in 2010.\n\n\"Guinness World Records\" has called the CN Tower \"the world's tallest self-supporting tower\" and \"the world's tallest free-standing tower\". Although Guinness did list this description of the CN Tower under the heading \"tallest building\" at least once, it has also listed it under \"tallest tower\", omitting it from its list of \"tallest buildings.\" In 1996, Guinness changed the tower's classification to \"World's Tallest Building and Freestanding Structure\". Emporis and the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat both listed the CN Tower as the world's tallest free-standing structure on land, and specifically state that the CN Tower is not a true building, thereby awarding the title of world's tallest building to Taipei 101, which is shorter than the CN Tower. The issue of what was tallest became moot when Burj Khalifa, then under construction, exceeded the height of the CN Tower in 2007 (see below).\n\nAlthough the CN Tower contains a restaurant, a gift shop and multiple observation levels, it does not have floors continuously from the ground, and therefore it is not considered a building by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH) or Emporis. CTBUH defines a building as \"a structure that is designed for residential, business, or manufacturing purposes. An essential characteristic of a building is that it has floors.\" The CN Tower and other similar structures—such as the Ostankino Tower in Moscow, Russia; the Oriental Pearl Tower in Shanghai, China; the Stratosphere Tower in Las Vegas, Nevada, USA; and the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France—are categorized as \"towers\", which are free-standing structures that may have observation decks and a few other habitable levels, but do not have floors from the ground up. The CN Tower was the tallest tower by this definition, until 2010 (see below).\n\nTaller than the CN Tower are numerous radio masts and towers, which are held in place by guy-wires, the tallest being the KVLY-TV mast in Blanchard, North Dakota, USA at tall, leading to a distinction between these and \"free-standing\" structures. Additionally, the Petronius Platform stands above its base on the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico, but only the top of this oil and natural gas platform are above water, and the structure is thus partially supported by its buoyancy. Like the CN Tower, none of these taller structures are commonly considered buildings.\n\nOn September 12, 2007, Burj Khalifa, which is a hotel, residential and commercial building in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, and was formerly known as Burj Dubai before opening, passed the CN Tower's 553.33-metre height. The CN Tower held the record of tallest free-standing structure on land for over 30 years.\n\nAfter Burj Khalifa had been formally recognized by the Guinness World Records as the world's tallest freestanding structure, Guinness re-certified CN Tower as the world's tallest freestanding tower. The tower definition used by Guinness was defined by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat as 'a building in which less than 50% of the construction is usable floor space'. \"Guinness World Records\" editor-in-chief Craig Glenday announced that Burj Khalifa was not classified as a tower because it has too much usable floor space to be considered to be a tower. CN Tower still held world records for highest above ground wine cellar (in 360 Restaurant) at 351 metres, highest above ground restaurant at 346 metres (Horizons Restaurant), and tallest free-standing concrete tower during Guinness's recertification. The CN Tower was surpassed in 2009 by the Canton Tower in Guangzhou, China, which stands at tall, as the world's tallest tower; which in turn was surpassed by the Tokyo Skytree in 2011, which currently is the tallest tower at in height. The CN Tower, as of 2017, stands as the eighth-tallest free-standing structure on land in the world and the third-tallest free-standing tower.\n\nSince the construction of the tower had been completed, it has gained the following world height records:\n\nThe CN Tower has been and continues to be used as a communications tower for a number of different media and by numerous companies.\n\nThere is no AM broadcasting on the CN Tower. The FM antennas are situated above ground.\n\n\n\nThe CN Tower has its own mascot, which resembles the tower itself.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6113", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6113", "title": "Chain rule", "text": "Chain rule\n\nIn calculus, the chain rule is a formula for computing the derivative of the composition of two or more functions. That is, if \"f\" and \"g\" are functions, then the chain rule expresses the derivative of their composition (the function which maps \"x\" to \"f\"(\"g\"(\"x\")) ) in terms of the derivatives of \"f\" and \"g\" and the product of functions as follows:\n\nThis can be written more explicitly in terms of the variable. Let , or equivalently, for all \"x\". Then one can also write\n\nThe chain rule may be written, in Leibniz's notation, in the following way. If a variable \"z\" depends on the variable \"y\", which itself depends on the variable \"x\", so that \"y\" and \"z\" are therefore dependent variables, then \"z\", via the intermediate variable of \"y\", depends on \"x\" as well. The chain rule then states,\n\nThe two versions of the chain rule are related, if formula_4 and formula_5, then\n\nIn integration, the counterpart to the chain rule is the substitution rule.\n\nThe chain rule seems to have first been used by Leibniz. He used it to calculate the derivative of formula_7 as the composite of the square root function and the function formula_8. He first mentioned it in a 1676 memoir (with a sign error in the calculation). The common notation of chain rule is due to Leibniz. L'Hôpital uses the chain rule implicitly in his \"Analyse des infiniment petits\". The chain rule does not appear in any of Leonhard Euler's analysis books, even though they were written over a hundred years after Leibniz's discovery.\n\nSuppose that a skydiver jumps from an aircraft. Assume that \"t\" seconds after his jump, his height above sea level in meters is given by . One model for the atmospheric pressure at a height \"h\" is . These two equations can be differentiated and combined in various ways to produce the following data:\nThe chain rule gives a method for computing in terms of and . While it is always possible to directly apply the definition of the derivative to compute the derivative of a composite function, this is usually very difficult. The utility of the chain rule is that it turns a complicated derivative into several easy derivatives.\n\nThe chain rule states that, under appropriate conditions,\nIn this example, this equals\n\nIn the statement of the chain rule, \"f\" and \"g\" play slightly different roles because \"f\"′ is evaluated at \"g\"(\"t\") whereas \"g\"′ is evaluated at \"t\". This is necessary to make the units work out correctly. For example, suppose that we want to compute the rate of change in atmospheric pressure ten seconds after the skydiver jumps. This is and has units of Pascals per second. The factor \"g\"′(10) in the chain rule is the velocity of the skydiver ten seconds after his jump, and it is expressed in meters per second. \"f\"′(\"g\"(10)) is the change in pressure with respect to height at the height \"g\"(10) and is expressed in Pascals per meter. The product of \"f\"′(\"g\"(10)) and \"g\"′(10) therefore has the correct units of Pascals per second. It is not possible to evaluate \"f\" anywhere else. For instance, because the 10 in the problem represents ten seconds, the expression \"f\"′(10) represents the change in pressure at a height of ten seconds, which is nonsense. Similarly, because meters per second, the expression \"f\"′(\"g\"′(10)) represents the change in pressure at a height of −98 meters per second, which is also nonsense. However, \"g\"(10) is 3020 meters above sea level, the height of the skydiver ten seconds after his jump. This has the correct units for an input to \"f\".\n\nThe simplest form of the chain rule is for real-valued functions of one real variable. It says that if \"g\" is a function that is differentiable at a point \"c\" (i.e. the derivative \"g\"′(\"c\") exists) and \"f\" is a function that is differentiable at \"g\"(\"c\"), then the composite function is differentiable at \"c\", and the derivative is\n\nThe rule is sometimes abbreviated as\n\nIf and , then this abbreviated form is written in Leibniz notation as:\n\nThe points where the derivatives are evaluated may also be stated explicitly:\n\nIt may be possible to apply the chain rule even when there are no formulas for the functions which are being differentiated. This can happen when the derivatives are measured directly. Suppose that a car is driving up a tall mountain. The car's speedometer measures its speed directly. If the grade is known, then the rate of ascent can be calculated using trigonometry. Suppose that the car is ascending at . Standard models for the Earth's atmosphere imply that the temperature drops about per kilometer ascended (called the lapse rate). To find the temperature drop per hour, we apply the chain rule. Let the function be the altitude of the car at time , and let the function be the temperature kilometers above sea level. and are not known exactly: For example, the altitude where the car starts is not known and the temperature on the mountain is not known. However, their derivatives are known: is , and is . The chain rule says that the derivative of the composite function is the product of the derivative of and the derivative of . This is .\n\nOne of the reasons why this computation is possible is because is a constant function. This is because the above model is very simple. A more accurate description of how the temperature near the car varies over time would require an accurate model of how the temperature varies at different altitudes. This model may not have a constant derivative. To compute the temperature change in such a model, it would be necessary to know and not just , because without knowing it is not possible to know where to evaluate .\n\nThe chain rule can be applied to composites of more than two functions. To take the derivative of a composite of more than two functions, notice that the composite of \"f\", \"g\", and \"h\" (in that order) is the composite of \"f\" with . The chain rule says that to compute the derivative of , it is sufficient to compute the derivative of \"f\" and the derivative of . The derivative of \"f\" can be calculated directly, and the derivative of can be calculated by applying the chain rule again.\n\nFor concreteness, consider the function\nThis can be decomposed as the composite of three functions:\nTheir derivatives are:\nThe chain rule says that the derivative of their composite at the point is:\nIn Leibniz notation, this is:\nor for short,\nThe derivative function is therefore:\n\nAnother way of computing this derivative is to view the composite function as the composite of and \"h\". Applying the chain rule to this situation gives:\nThis is the same as what was computed above. This should be expected because .\n\nSometimes it is necessary to differentiate an arbitrarily long composition of the form formula_23. In this case, define\nwhere formula_25 and formula_26 when formula_27. Then the chain rule takes the form\nor, in the Lagrange notation,\n\nThe chain rule can be used to derive some well-known differentiation rules. For example, the quotient rule is a consequence of the chain rule and the product rule. To see this, write the function \"f\"(\"x\")/\"g\"(\"x\") as the product . First apply the product rule:\nTo compute the derivative of 1/\"g\"(\"x\"), notice that it is the composite of \"g\" with the reciprocal function, that is, the function that sends \"x\" to 1/\"x\". The derivative of the reciprocal function is −1/\"x\". By applying the chain rule, the last expression becomes:\nwhich is the usual formula for the quotient rule.\n\nSuppose that has an inverse function. Call its inverse function \"f\" so that we have . There is a formula for the derivative of \"f\" in terms of the derivative of \"g\". To see this, note that \"f\" and \"g\" satisfy the formula\nBecause the functions \"f\"(\"g\"(\"x\")) and \"x\" are equal, their derivatives must be equal. The derivative of \"x\" is the constant function with value 1, and the derivative of \"f\"(\"g\"(\"x\")) is determined by the chain rule. Therefore, we have:\nTo express \"f\"′ as a function of an independent variable \"y\", we substitute \"f\"(\"y\") for \"x\" wherever it appears. Then we can solve for \"f\"′.\n\nFor example, consider the function . It has an inverse . Because , the above formula says that\n\nThis formula is true whenever \"g\" is differentiable and its inverse \"f\" is also differentiable. This formula can fail when one of these conditions is not true. For example, consider . Its inverse is , which is not differentiable at zero. If we attempt to use the above formula to compute the derivative of \"f\" at zero, then we must evaluate 1/\"g\"′(\"f\"(0)). and , so we must evaluate 1/0, which is undefined. Therefore, the formula fails in this case. This is not surprising because \"f\" is not differentiable at zero.\n\nFaà di Bruno's formula generalizes the chain rule to higher derivatives. Assuming that and , then the first few derivatives are:\n\nOne proof of the chain rule begins with the definition of the derivative:\nAssume for the moment that \"g\"(\"x\") does not equal \"g\"(\"a\") for any \"x\" near \"a\". Then the previous expression is equal to the product of two factors:\nWhen \"g\" oscillates near \"a\", then it might happen that no matter how close one gets to \"a\", there is always an even closer \"x\" such that \"g\"(\"x\") equals \"g\"(\"a\"). For example, this happens for near the point . Whenever this happens, the above expression is undefined because it involves division by zero. To work around this, introduce a function \"Q\" as follows:\nWe will show that the difference quotient for is always equal to:\nWhenever \"g\"(\"x\") is not equal to \"g\"(\"a\"), this is clear because the factors of cancel. When \"g\"(\"x\") equals \"g\"(\"a\"), then the difference quotient for is zero because \"f\"(\"g\"(\"x\")) equals \"f\"(\"g\"(\"a\")), and the above product is zero because it equals \"f\"′(\"g\"(\"a\")) times zero. So the above product is always equal to the difference quotient, and to show that the derivative of at \"a\" exists and to determine its value, we need only show that the limit as \"x\" goes to \"a\" of the above product exists and determine its value.\n\nTo do this, recall that the limit of a product exists if the limits of its factors exist. When this happens, the limit of the product of these two factors will equal the product of the limits of the factors. The two factors are \"Q\"(\"g\"(\"x\")) and . The latter is the difference quotient for \"g\" at \"a\", and because \"g\" is differentiable at \"a\" by assumption, its limit as \"x\" tends to \"a\" exists and equals \"g\"′(\"a\").\n\nIt remains to study \"Q\"(\"g\"(\"x\")). \"Q\" is defined wherever \"f\" is. Furthermore, because \"f\" is differentiable at \"g\"(\"a\") by assumption, \"Q\" is continuous at \"g\"(\"a\"). \"g\" is continuous at \"a\" because it is differentiable at \"a\", and therefore is continuous at \"a\". So its limit as \"x\" goes to \"a\" exists and equals \"Q\"(\"g\"(\"a\")), which is \"f\"′(\"g\"(\"a\")).\n\nThis shows that the limits of both factors exist and that they equal \"f\"′(\"g\"(\"a\")) and \"g\"′(\"a\"), respectively. Therefore, the derivative of at \"a\" exists and equals \"f\"′(\"g\"(\"a\"))\"g\"′(\"a\").\n\nAnother way of proving the chain rule is to measure the error in the linear approximation determined by the derivative. This proof has the advantage that it generalizes to several variables. It relies on the following equivalent definition of differentiability at a point: A function \"g\" is differentiable at \"a\" if there exists a real number \"g\"′(\"a\") and a function \"ε\"(\"h\") that tends to zero as \"h\" tends to zero, and furthermore\nHere the left-hand side represents the true difference between the value of \"g\" at \"a\" and at , whereas the right-hand side represents the approximation determined by the derivative plus an error term.\n\nIn the situation of the chain rule, such a function \"ε\" exists because \"g\" is assumed to be differentiable at \"a\". Again by assumption, a similar function also exists for \"f\" at \"g\"(\"a\"). Calling this function \"η\", we have\nThe above definition imposes no constraints on \"η\"(0), even though it is assumed that \"η\"(\"k\") tends to zero as \"k\" tends to zero. If we set , then \"η\" is continuous at 0.\n\nProving the theorem requires studying the difference as \"h\" tends to zero. The first step is to substitute for using the definition of differentiability of \"g\" at \"a\":\nThe next step is to use the definition of differentiability of \"f\" at \"g\"(\"a\"). This requires a term of the form for some \"k\". In the above equation, the correct \"k\" varies with \"h\". Set and the right hand side becomes . Applying the definition of the derivative gives:\nTo study the behavior of this expression as \"h\" tends to zero, expand \"k\". After regrouping the terms, the right-hand side becomes:\nBecause \"ε\"(\"h\") and \"η\"(\"k\") tend to zero as \"h\" tends to zero, the first two bracketed terms tend to zero as \"h\" tends to zero. Applying the same theorem on products of limits as in the first proof, the third bracketed term also tends zero. Because the above expression is equal to the difference , by the definition of the derivative is differentiable at \"a\" and its derivative is \n\nThe role of \"Q\" in the first proof is played by \"η\" in this proof. They are related by the equation:\nThe need to define \"Q\" at \"g\"(\"a\") is analogous to the need to define \"η\" at zero.\n\nCarathéodory's alternative definition of the differentiability of a function can be used to give an elegant proof of the chain rule.\n\nUnder this definition, a function is differentiable at a point if and only if there is a function , continuous at and such that . There is at most one such function, and if is differentiable at then .\n\nGiven the assumptions of the chain rule and the fact that differentiable functions and compositions of continuous functions are continuous, we have that there exist functions , continuous at and , continuous at and such that,\nand\nTherefore,\nbut the function given by is continuous at , and we get, for this \nA similar approach works for continuously differentiable (vector-)functions of many variables. This ideology of factoring also allows a unified approach to stronger forms of differentiability, when the derivative is required to be Lipschitz, Holder, etc. Differentiation itself can be viewed as the polynomial remainder theorem (the little Bezout, or factor theorem), generalized to an appropriate class of functions. \n\nIf formula_54 and formula_55 then choosing infinitesimal formula_56 we compute the corresponding formula_57 and then the corresponding formula_58, so that\nand applying the standard part we obtain\nwhich is the chain rule.\n\nThe simplest generalization of the chain rule to higher dimensions uses the total derivative. The total derivative is a linear transformation that captures how the function changes in all directions. Fix differentiable functions and and a point a in R. Let \"D\"\"g\" denote the total derivative of \"g\" at a and \"D\"\"f\" denote the total derivative of \"f\" at \"g\"(a). These two derivatives are linear transformations and , respectively, so they can be composed. The chain rule for total derivatives says that their composite is the total derivative of at a:\nor for short,\nThe higher-dimensional chain rule can be proved using a technique similar to the second proof given above.\n\nBecause the total derivative is a linear transformation, the functions appearing in the formula can be rewritten as matrices. The matrix corresponding to a total derivative is called a Jacobian matrix, and the composite of two derivatives corresponds to the product of their Jacobian matrices. From this perspective the chain rule therefore says:\nor for short,\n\nThat is, the Jacobian of a composite function is the product of the Jacobians of the composed functions (evaluated at the appropriate points).\n\nThe higher-dimensional chain rule is a generalization of the one-dimensional chain rule. If \"k\", \"m\", and \"n\" are 1, so that and , then the Jacobian matrices of \"f\" and \"g\" are . Specifically, they are:\nThe Jacobian of \"f\" ∘ \"g\" is the product of these matrices, so it is , as expected from the one-dimensional chain rule. In the language of linear transformations, \"D\"(\"g\") is the function which scales a vector by a factor of \"g\"′(\"a\") and \"D\"(\"f\") is the function which scales a vector by a factor of \"f\"′(\"g\"(\"a\")). The chain rule says that the composite of these two linear transformations is the linear transformation , and therefore it is the function that scales a vector by \"f\"′(\"g\"(\"a\"))⋅\"g\"′(\"a\").\n\nAnother way of writing the chain rule is used when \"f\" and \"g\" are expressed in terms of their components as and . In this case, the above rule for Jacobian matrices is usually written as:\n\nThe chain rule for total derivatives implies a chain rule for partial derivatives. Recall that when the total derivative exists, the partial derivative in the \"i\"th coordinate direction is found by multiplying the Jacobian matrix by the \"i\"th basis vector. By doing this to the formula above, we find:\nSince the entries of the Jacobian matrix are partial derivatives, we may simplify the above formula to get:\nMore conceptually, this rule expresses the fact that a change in the \"x\" direction may change all of \"g\" through \"g\", and any of these changes may affect \"f\".\n\nIn the special case where , so that \"f\" is a real-valued function, then this formula simplifies even further:\nThis can be rewritten as a dot product. Recalling that , the partial derivative is also a vector, and the chain rule says that:\n\nGiven where and , determine the value of and using the chain rule.\nand\n\nFaà di Bruno's formula for higher-order derivatives of single-variable functions generalizes to the multivariable case. If is a function of as above, then the second derivative of is:\n\nAll extensions of calculus have a chain rule. In most of these, the formula remains the same, though the meaning of that formula may be vastly different.\n\nOne generalization is to manifolds. In this situation, the chain rule represents the fact that the derivative of is the composite of the derivative of \"f\" and the derivative of \"g\". This theorem is an immediate consequence of the higher dimensional chain rule given above, and it has exactly the same formula.\n\nThe chain rule is also valid for Fréchet derivatives in Banach spaces. The same formula holds as before. This case and the previous one admit a simultaneous generalization to Banach manifolds.\n\nIn abstract algebra, the derivative is interpreted as a morphism of modules of Kähler differentials. A ring homomorphism of commutative rings determines a morphism of Kähler differentials which sends an element \"dr\" to \"d\"(\"f\"(\"r\")), the exterior differential of \"f\"(\"r\"). The formula holds in this context as well.\n\nThe common feature of these examples is that they are expressions of the idea that the derivative is part of a functor. A functor is an operation on spaces and functions between them. It associates to each space a new space and to each function between two spaces a new function between the corresponding new spaces. In each of the above cases, the functor sends each space to its tangent bundle and it sends each function to its derivative. For example, in the manifold case, the derivative sends a \"C\"-manifold to a \"C\"-manifold (its tangent bundle) and a \"C\"-function to its total derivative. There is one requirement for this to be a functor, namely that the derivative of a composite must be the composite of the derivatives. This is exactly the formula .\n\nThere are also chain rules in stochastic calculus. One of these, Itō's lemma, expresses the composite of an Itō process (or more generally a semimartingale) \"dX\" with a twice-differentiable function \"f\". In Itō's lemma, the derivative of the composite function depends not only on \"dX\" and the derivative of \"f\" but also on the second derivative of \"f\". The dependence on the second derivative is a consequence of the non-zero quadratic variation of the stochastic process, which broadly speaking means that the process can move up and down in a very rough way. This variant of the chain rule is not an example of a functor because the two functions being composed are of different types.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6115", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6115", "title": "P versus NP problem", "text": "P versus NP problem\n\nThe P versus NP problem is a major unsolved problem in computer science. Informally speaking, it asks whether every problem whose solution can be quickly verified by a computer can also be quickly solved by a computer.\n\nThe underlying issues were first discussed in the 1950s, in letters from John Forbes Nash Jr. to the National Security Agency, and from Kurt Gödel to John von Neumann. The precise statement of the P versus NP problem was introduced in 1971 by Stephen Cook in his seminal paper \"The complexity of theorem proving procedures\" and is considered by many to be the most important open problem in the field. It is one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems selected by the Clay Mathematics Institute to carry a US$1,000,000 prize for the first correct solution.\n\nThe informal term \"quickly\", used above, means the existence of an algorithm solving the task that runs in polynomial time, such that the time to complete the task varies as a polynomial function on the size of the input to the algorithm (as opposed to, say, exponential time). The general class of questions for which some algorithm can provide an answer in polynomial time is called \"class P\" or just \"P\". For some questions, there is no known way to find an answer quickly, but if one is provided with information showing what the answer is, it is possible to verify the answer quickly. The class of questions for which an answer can be \"verified\" in polynomial time is called NP, which stands for \"nondeterministic polynomial time\".\n\nConsider the subset sum problem, an example of a problem that is easy to verify, but whose answer may be difficult to compute. Given a set of integers, does some nonempty subset of them sum to 0? For instance, does a subset of the set add up to 0? The answer \"yes, because the subset adds up to zero\" can be quickly verified with three additions. There is no known algorithm to find such a subset in polynomial time (there is one, however, in exponential time, which consists of 2-n-1 tries), but such an algorithm exists if P = NP; hence this problem is in NP (quickly checkable) but not necessarily in P (quickly solvable).\n\nAn answer to the P = NP question would determine whether problems that can be verified in polynomial time, like the subset-sum problem, can also be solved in polynomial time. If it turned out that P ≠ NP, it would mean that there are problems in NP (such as NP-complete problems) that are harder to compute than to verify: they could not be solved in polynomial time, but the answer could be verified in polynomial time.\n\nAside from being an important problem in computational theory, a proof either way would have profound implications for mathematics, cryptography, algorithm research, artificial intelligence, game theory, multimedia processing, philosophy, economics and many other fields.\n\nAlthough the P versus NP problem was formally defined in 1971, there were previous inklings of the problems involved, the difficulty of proof, and the potential consequences. In 1955, mathematician John Nash wrote a letter to the NSA, where he speculated that cracking a sufficiently complex code would require time exponential in the length of the key. If proved (and Nash was suitably skeptical) this would imply what we today would call P ≠ NP, since a proposed key can easily be verified in polynomial time. Another mention of the underlying problem occurred in a 1956 letter written by Kurt Gödel to John von Neumann. Gödel asked whether theorem-proving (now known to be co-NP-complete) could be solved in quadratic or linear time, and pointed out one of the most important consequences - that if so, then the discovery of mathematical proofs could be automated.\n\nThe relation between the complexity classes P and NP is studied in computational complexity theory, the part of the theory of computation dealing with the resources required during computation to solve a given problem. The most common resources are time (how many steps it takes to solve a problem) and space (how much memory it takes to solve a problem).\n\nIn such analysis, a model of the computer for which time must be analyzed is required. Typically such models assume that the computer is \"deterministic\" (given the computer's present state and any inputs, there is only one possible action that the computer might take) and \"sequential\" (it performs actions one after the other).\n\nIn this theory, the class P consists of all those \"decision problems\" (defined below) that can be solved on a deterministic sequential machine in an amount of time that is polynomial in the size of the input; the class NP consists of all those decision problems whose positive solutions can be verified in polynomial time given the right information, or equivalently, whose solution can be found in polynomial time on a non-deterministic machine. Clearly, P ⊆ NP. Arguably the biggest open question in theoretical computer science concerns the relationship between those two classes:\nIn a 2002 poll of 100 researchers, 61 believed the answer to be no, 9 believed the answer is yes, and 22 were unsure; 8 believed the question may be independent of the currently accepted axioms and therefore impossible to prove or disprove.\n\nIn 2012, 10 years later, the same poll was repeated. The number of researchers who answered was 151: 126 (83%) believed the answer to be no, 12 (9%) believed the answer is yes, 5 (3%) believed the question may be independent of the currently accepted axioms and therefore impossible to prove or disprove, 8 (5%) said either don't know or don't care or don't want the answer to be yes nor the problem to be resolved.\n\nTo attack the P = NP question, the concept of NP-completeness is very useful. NP-complete problems are a set of problems to each of which any other NP-problem can be reduced in polynomial time, and whose solution may still be verified in polynomial time. That is, any NP problem can be transformed into any of the NP-complete problems. Informally, an NP-complete problem is an NP problem that is at least as \"tough\" as any other problem in NP.\n\nNP-hard problems are those at least as hard as NP problems, i.e., all NP problems can be reduced (in polynomial time) to them. NP-hard problems need not be in NP, i.e., they need not have solutions verifiable in polynomial time.\n\nFor instance, the Boolean satisfiability problem is NP-complete by the Cook–Levin theorem, so \"any\" instance of \"any\" problem in NP can be transformed mechanically into an instance of the Boolean satisfiability problem in polynomial time. The Boolean satisfiability problem is one of many such NP-complete problems. If any NP-complete problem is in P, then it would follow that P = NP. However, many important problems have been shown to be NP-complete, and no fast algorithm for any of them is known.\n\nBased on the definition alone it is not obvious that NP-complete problems exist; however, a trivial and contrived NP-complete problem can be formulated as follows: given a description of a Turing machine M guaranteed to halt in polynomial time, does there exist a polynomial-size input that M will accept? It is in NP because (given an input) it is simple to check whether M accepts the input by simulating M; it is NP-complete because the verifier for any particular instance of a problem in NP can be encoded as a polynomial-time machine M that takes the solution to be verified as input. Then the question of whether the instance is a yes or no instance is determined by whether a valid input exists.\n\nThe first natural problem proven to be NP-complete was the Boolean satisfiability problem. As noted above, this is the Cook–Levin theorem; its proof that satisfiability is NP-complete contains technical details about Turing machines as they relate to the definition of NP. However, after this problem was proved to be NP-complete, proof by reduction provided a simpler way to show that many other problems are also NP-complete, including the subset sum problem discussed earlier. Thus, a vast class of seemingly unrelated problems are all reducible to one another, and are in a sense \"the same problem\".\n\nAlthough it is unknown whether P = NP, problems outside of P are known. A number of succinct problems (problems that operate not on normal input, but on a computational description of the input) are known to be EXPTIME-complete. Because it can be shown that P ≠ EXPTIME, these problems are outside P, and so require more than polynomial time. In fact, by the time hierarchy theorem, they cannot be solved in significantly less than exponential time. Examples include finding a perfect strategy for chess (on an \"N\" × \"N\" board) and some other board games.\n\nThe problem of deciding the truth of a statement in Presburger arithmetic requires even more time. Fischer and Rabin proved in 1974 that every algorithm that decides the truth of Presburger statements has a runtime of at least formula_1 for some constant \"c\". Here, \"n\" is the length of the Presburger statement. Hence, the problem is known to need more than exponential run time. Even more difficult are the undecidable problems, such as the halting problem. They cannot be completely solved by any algorithm, in the sense that for any particular algorithm there is at least one input for which that algorithm will not produce the right answer; it will either produce the wrong answer, finish without giving a conclusive answer, or otherwise run forever without producing any answer at all.\n\nIt was shown by Ladner that if P ≠ NP then there exist problems in NP that are neither in P nor NP-complete. Such problems are called NP-intermediate problems. The graph isomorphism problem, the discrete logarithm problem and the integer factorization problem are examples of problems believed to be NP-intermediate. They are some of the very few NP problems not known to be in P or to be NP-complete.\n\nThe graph isomorphism problem is the computational problem of determining whether two finite graphs are isomorphic. An important unsolved problem in complexity theory is whether the graph isomorphism problem is in P, NP-complete, or NP-intermediate. The answer is not known, but it is believed that the problem is at least not NP-complete. If graph isomorphism is NP-complete, the polynomial time hierarchy collapses to its second level. Since it is widely believed that the polynomial hierarchy does not collapse to any finite level, it is believed that graph isomorphism is not NP-complete. The best algorithm for this problem, due to László Babai and Eugene Luks, has run time 2 for graphs with \"n\" vertices.\n\nThe integer factorization problem is the computational problem of determining the prime factorization of a given integer. Phrased as a decision problem, it is the problem of deciding whether the input has a factor less than \"k\". No efficient integer factorization algorithm is known, and this fact forms the basis of several modern cryptographic systems, such as the RSA algorithm. The integer factorization problem is in NP and in co-NP (and even in UP and co-UP). If the problem is NP-complete, the polynomial time hierarchy will collapse to its first level (i.e., NP = co-NP). The best known algorithm for integer factorization is the general number field sieve, which takes expected time\n\nto factor an \"n\"-bit integer. However, the best known quantum algorithm for this problem, Shor's algorithm, does run in polynomial time, although this does not indicate where the problem lies with respect to non-quantum complexity classes.\n\nAll of the above discussion has assumed that P means \"easy\" and \"not in P\" means \"hard\", an assumption known as \"Cobham's thesis\". It is a common and reasonably accurate assumption in complexity theory; however, it has some caveats.\n\nFirst, it is not always true in practice. A theoretical polynomial algorithm may have extremely large constant factors or exponents thus rendering it impractical. On the other hand, even if a problem is shown to be NP-complete, and even if P ≠ NP, there may still be effective approaches to tackling the problem in practice. There are algorithms for many NP-complete problems, such as the knapsack problem, the traveling salesman problem and the Boolean satisfiability problem, that can solve to optimality many real-world instances in reasonable time. The empirical average-case complexity (time vs. problem size) of such algorithms can be surprisingly low. An example is the simplex algorithm in linear programming, which works surprisingly well in practice; despite having exponential worst-case time complexity it runs on par with the best known polynomial-time algorithms.\n\nSecond, there are types of computations which do not conform to the Turing machine model on which P and NP are defined, such as quantum computation and randomized algorithms.\n\nAccording to polls, most computer scientists believe that P ≠ NP. A key reason for this belief is that after decades of studying these problems no one has been able to find a polynomial-time algorithm for any of more than 3000 important known NP-complete problems (see List of NP-complete problems). These algorithms were sought long before the concept of NP-completeness was even defined (Karp's 21 NP-complete problems, among the first found, were all well-known existing problems at the time they were shown to be NP-complete). Furthermore, the result P = NP would imply many other startling results that are currently believed to be false, such as NP = co-NP and P = PH.\n\nIt is also intuitively argued that the existence of problems that are hard to solve but for which the solutions are easy to verify matches real-world experience.\nOn the other hand, some researchers believe that there is overconfidence in believing P ≠ NP and that researchers should explore proofs of P = NP as well. For example, in 2002 these statements were made:\n\nOne of the reasons the problem attracts so much attention is the consequences of the answer. Either direction of resolution would advance theory enormously, and perhaps have huge practical consequences as well.\n\nA proof that P = NP could have stunning practical consequences, if the proof leads to efficient methods for solving some of the important problems in NP. It is also possible that a proof would not lead directly to efficient methods, perhaps if the proof is non-constructive, or the size of the bounding polynomial is too big to be efficient in practice. The consequences, both positive and negative, arise since various NP-complete problems are fundamental in many fields.\n\nCryptography, for example, relies on certain problems being difficult. A constructive and efficient solution to an NP-complete problem such as 3-SAT would break most existing cryptosystems including:\nThese would need to be modified or replaced by information-theoretically secure solutions not inherently based on P-NP equivalence.\n\nOn the other hand, there are enormous positive consequences that would follow from rendering tractable many currently mathematically intractable problems. For instance, many problems in operations research are NP-complete, such as some types of integer programming and the travelling salesman problem. Efficient solutions to these problems would have enormous implications for logistics. Many other important problems, such as some problems in protein structure prediction, are also NP-complete; if these problems were efficiently solvable it could spur considerable advances in life sciences and biotechnology.\n\nBut such changes may pale in significance compared to the revolution an efficient method for solving NP-complete problems would cause in mathematics itself. Gödel, in his early thoughts on computational complexity, noted that a mechanical method that could solve any problem would revolutionize mathematics:\n\nSimilarly, Stephen Cook says\n\nResearch mathematicians spend their careers trying to prove theorems, and some proofs have taken decades or even centuries to find after problems have been stated—for instance, Fermat's Last Theorem took over three centuries to prove. A method that is guaranteed to find proofs to theorems, should one exist of a \"reasonable\" size, would essentially end this struggle.\n\nDonald Knuth has stated that he has come to believe that P = NP, but is reserved about the impact of a possible proof:\nA proof that showed that P ≠ NP would lack the practical computational benefits of a proof that P = NP, but would nevertheless represent a very significant advance in computational complexity theory and provide guidance for future research. It would allow one to show in a formal way that many common problems cannot be solved efficiently, so that the attention of researchers can be focused on partial solutions or solutions to other problems. Due to widespread belief in P ≠ NP, much of this focusing of research has already taken place.\n\nAlso P ≠ NP still leaves open the average-case complexity of hard problems in NP. For example, it is possible that SAT requires exponential time in the worst case, but that almost all randomly selected instances of it are efficiently solvable. Russell Impagliazzo has described five hypothetical \"worlds\" that could result from different possible resolutions to the average-case complexity question. These range from \"Algorithmica\", where P = NP and problems like SAT can be solved efficiently in all instances, to \"Cryptomania\", where P ≠ NP and generating hard instances of problems outside P is easy, with three intermediate possibilities reflecting different possible distributions of difficulty over instances of NP-hard problems. The \"world\" where P ≠ NP but all problems in NP are tractable in the average case is called \"Heuristica\" in the paper. A Princeton University workshop in 2009 studied the status of the five worlds.\n\nAlthough the P = NP problem itself remains open despite a million-dollar prize and a huge amount of dedicated research, efforts to solve the problem have led to several new techniques. In particular, some of the most fruitful research related to the P = NP problem has been in showing that existing proof techniques are not powerful enough to answer the question, thus suggesting that novel technical approaches are required.\n\nAs additional evidence for the difficulty of the problem, essentially all known proof techniques in computational complexity theory fall into one of the following classifications, each of which is known to be insufficient to prove that P ≠ NP:\nThese barriers are another reason why NP-complete problems are useful: if a polynomial-time algorithm can be demonstrated for an NP-complete problem, this would solve the P = NP problem in a way not excluded by the above results.\n\nThese barriers have also led some computer scientists to suggest that the P versus NP problem may be independent of standard axiom systems like ZFC (cannot be proved or disproved within them). The interpretation of an independence result could be that either no polynomial-time algorithm exists for any NP-complete problem, and such a proof cannot be constructed in (e.g.) ZFC, or that polynomial-time algorithms for NP-complete problems may exist, but it is impossible to prove in ZFC that such algorithms are correct. However, if it can be shown, using techniques of the sort that are currently known to be applicable, that the problem cannot be decided even with much weaker assumptions extending the Peano axioms (PA) for integer arithmetic, then there would necessarily exist nearly-polynomial-time algorithms for every problem in NP. Therefore, if one believes (as most complexity theorists do) that not all problems in NP have efficient algorithms, it would follow that proofs of independence using those techniques cannot be possible. Additionally, this result implies that proving independence from PA or ZFC using currently known techniques is no easier than proving the existence of efficient algorithms for all problems in NP.\n\nWhile the P versus NP problem is generally considered unsolved, many amateur and some professional researchers have claimed solutions. Gerhard J. Woeginger has a comprehensive list. As of 2016, this list contained 62 purported proofs of P = NP and 50 of P ≠ NP. An August 2010 claim of proof that P ≠ NP, by Vinay Deolalikar, a researcher at HP Labs, received heavy Internet and press attention after being initially described as \" to be a relatively serious attempt\" by two leading specialists. The proof has been reviewed publicly by academics, and Neil Immerman, an expert in the field, has pointed out two possibly fatal errors in the proof.\nIn September 2010, Deolalikar was reported to be working on a detailed expansion of his attempted proof. However, opinions expressed by several notable theoretical computer scientists indicate that the attempted proof is neither correct nor a significant advancement in the understanding of the problem. This assessment prompted a May 2013 \"The New Yorker\" article to call the proof attempt \"thoroughly discredited\".\n\nThe P = NP problem can be restated in terms of expressible certain classes of logical statements, as a result of work in descriptive complexity.\n\nConsider all languages of finite structures with a fixed signature including a linear order relation. Then, all such languages in P can be expressed in first-order logic with the addition of a suitable least fixed-point combinator. Effectively, this, in combination with the order, allows the definition of recursive functions. As long as the signature contains at least one predicate or function in addition to the distinguished order relation, so that the amount of space taken to store such finite structures is actually polynomial in the number of elements in the structure, this precisely characterizes P.\n\nSimilarly, NP is the set of languages expressible in existential second-order logic—that is, second-order logic restricted to exclude universal quantification over relations, functions, and subsets. The languages in the polynomial hierarchy, PH, correspond to all of second-order logic. Thus, the question \"is P a proper subset of NP\" can be reformulated as \"is existential second-order logic able to describe languages (of finite linearly ordered structures with nontrivial signature) that first-order logic with least fixed point cannot?\". The word \"existential\" can even be dropped from the previous characterization, since P = NP if and only if P = PH (as the former would establish that NP = co-NP, which in turn implies that NP = PH).\n\nNo algorithm for any NP-complete problem is known to run in polynomial time. However, there are algorithms known for NP-complete problems with the property that if P = NP, then the algorithm runs in polynomial time on accepting instances (although with enormous constants, making the algorithm impractical). However, these algorithms do not qualify as polynomial time because their running time on rejecting instances are not polynomial. The following algorithm, due to Levin (without any citation), is such an example below. It correctly accepts the NP-complete language SUBSET-SUM. It runs in polynomial time on inputs that are in SUBSET-SUM if and only if P = NP:\n\nIf, and only if, P = NP, then this is a polynomial-time algorithm accepting an NP-complete language. \"Accepting\" means it gives \"yes\" answers in polynomial time, but is allowed to run forever when the answer is \"no\" (also known as a \"semi-algorithm\").\n\nThis algorithm is enormously impractical, even if P = NP. If the shortest program that can solve SUBSET-SUM in polynomial time is \"b\" bits long, the above algorithm will try at least 2−1 other programs first.\n\nConceptually speaking, a \"decision problem\" is a problem that takes as input some string \"w\" over an alphabet Σ, and outputs \"yes\" or \"no\". If there is an algorithm (say a Turing machine, or a computer program with unbounded memory) that can produce the correct answer for any input string of length \"n\" in at most \"cn\" steps, where \"k\" and \"c\" are constants independent of the input string, then we say that the problem can be solved in \"polynomial time\" and we place it in the class P. Formally, P is defined as the set of all languages that can be decided by a deterministic polynomial-time Turing machine. That is,\nwhere\nand a deterministic polynomial-time Turing machine is a deterministic Turing machine \"M\" that satisfies the following two conditions:\n\n\nNP can be defined similarly using nondeterministic Turing machines (the traditional way). However, a modern approach to define NP is to use the concept of \"certificate\" and \"verifier\". Formally, NP is defined as the set of languages over a finite alphabet that have a verifier that runs in polynomial time, where the notion of \"verifier\" is defined as follows.\n\nLet \"L\" be a language over a finite alphabet, Σ.\n\n\"L\" ∈ NP if, and only if, there exists a binary relation formula_9 and a positive integer \"k\" such that the following two conditions are satisfied:\n\n\nA Turing machine that decides \"L\" is called a \"verifier\" for \"L\" and a \"y\" such that (\"x\", \"y\") ∈ \"R\" is called a \"certificate of membership\" of \"x\" in \"L\".\n\nIn general, a verifier does not have to be polynomial-time. However, for \"L\" to be in NP, there must be a verifier that runs in polynomial time.\n\nLet\nClearly, the question of whether a given \"x\" is a composite is equivalent to the question of whether \"x\" is a member of COMPOSITE. It can be shown that COMPOSITE ∈ NP by verifying that it satisfies the above definition (if we identify natural numbers with their binary representations).\n\nCOMPOSITE also happens to be in P.\n\nThere are many equivalent ways of describing NP-completeness.\n\nLet \"L\" be a language over a finite alphabet Σ.\n\n\"L\" is NP-complete if, and only if, the following two conditions are satisfied:\n\n\nAlternatively, if \"L\" ∈ NP, and there is another NP-complete problem that can be polynomial-time reduced to \"L\", then \"L\" is NP-complete. This is a common way of proving some new problem is NP-complete.\n\n\n\n"}

Today he is appreciated largely for his contributions to logic, mathematics, philosophy, scientific methodology, and semiotics, and for his founding of pragmatism.\n\nAn innovator in mathematics, statistics, philosophy, research methodology, and various sciences, Peirce considered himself, first and foremost, a logician. He made major contributions to logic, but logic for him encompassed much of that which is now called epistemology and philosophy of science. He saw logic as the formal branch of semiotics, of which he is a founder, which foreshadowed the debate among logical positivists and proponents of philosophy of language that dominated 20th century Western philosophy; additionally, he defined the concept of abductive reasoning, as well as rigorously formulated mathematical induction and deductive reasoning. As early as 1886 he saw that logical operations could be carried out by electrical switching circuits; the same idea was used decades later to produce digital computers.\n\nIn 1934, the philosopher Paul Weiss called Peirce \"the most original and versatile of American philosophers and America's greatest logician.\" \"Webster's Biographical Dictionary\" said in 1943 that Peirce was \"now regarded as the most original thinker and greatest logician of his time.\" Keith Devlin similarly referred to Peirce as one of the greatest philosophers ever.\nPeirce was born at 3 Phillips Place in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He was the son of Sarah Hunt Mills and Benjamin Peirce, himself a professor of astronomy and mathematics at Harvard University and perhaps the first serious research mathematician in America. At age 12, Charles read his older brother's copy of Richard Whately's \"Elements of Logic\", then the leading English-language text on the subject. So began his lifelong fascination with logic and reasoning. He went on to earn the A.B. and A.M. (1862) from Harvard; in 1863 the Lawrence Scientific School awarded him a B.Sc. that was Harvard's first \"summa cum laude\" chemistry degree; and otherwise his academic record was undistinguished. At Harvard, he began lifelong friendships with Francis Ellingwood Abbot, Chauncey Wright, and William James. One of his Harvard instructors, Charles William Eliot, formed an unfavorable opinion of Peirce. This opinion proved fateful, because Eliot, while President of Harvard 1869–1909—a period encompassing nearly all of Peirce's working life—repeatedly vetoed Harvard's employing Peirce in any capacity.\n\nPeirce suffered from his late teens onward from a nervous condition then known as \"facial neuralgia\", which would today be diagnosed as trigeminal neuralgia. His biographer, Joseph Brent, says that when in the throes of its pain \"he was, at first, almost stupefied, and then aloof, cold, depressed, extremely suspicious, impatient of the slightest crossing, and subject to violent outbursts of temper\". Its consequences may have led to the social isolation which made his life's later years so tragic.\n\nBetween 1859 and 1891, Peirce was intermittently employed in various scientific capacities by the United States Coast Survey and its successor, the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, where he enjoyed his highly influential father's protection until the latter's death in 1880. That employment exempted Peirce from having to take part in the American Civil War; it would have been very awkward for him to do so, as the Boston Brahmin Peirces sympathized with the Confederacy. At the Survey, he worked mainly in geodesy and gravimetry, refining the use of pendulums to determine small local variations in the Earth's gravity. He was elected a resident fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in January 1867. The Survey sent him to Europe five times, first in 1871 as part of a group sent to observe a solar eclipse; there, he sought out Augustus De Morgan, William Stanley Jevons, and William Kingdon Clifford, British mathematicians and logicians whose turn of mind resembled his own. From 1869 to 1872, he was employed as an Assistant in Harvard's astronomical observatory, doing important work on determining the brightness of stars and the shape of the Milky Way. On April 20, 1877 he was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences. Also in 1877, he proposed measuring the meter as so many wavelengths of light of a certain frequency, the kind of definition employed from 1960 to 1983.\n\nDuring the 1880s, Peirce's indifference to bureaucratic detail waxed while his Survey work's quality and timeliness waned. Peirce took years to write reports that he should have completed in months. Meanwhile, he wrote entries, ultimately thousands during 1883–1909, on philosophy, logic, science, and other subjects for the encyclopedic \"Century Dictionary\". In 1885, an investigation by the Allison Commission exonerated Peirce, but led to the dismissal of Superintendent Julius Hilgard and several other Coast Survey employees for misuse of public funds. In 1891, Peirce resigned from the Coast Survey at Superintendent Thomas Corwin Mendenhall's request. He never again held regular employment.\n\nIn 1879, Peirce was appointed Lecturer in logic at Johns Hopkins University, which had strong departments in a number of areas that interested him, such as philosophy (Royce and Dewey completed their PhDs at Hopkins), psychology (taught by G. Stanley Hall and studied by Joseph Jastrow, who coauthored a landmark empirical study with Peirce), and mathematics (taught by J. J. Sylvester, who came to admire Peirce's work on mathematics and logic). His \"Studies in Logic by Members of the Johns Hopkins University\" (1883) contained works by himself and Allan Marquand, Christine Ladd, Benjamin Ives Gilman, and Oscar Howard Mitchell, several of whom were his graduate students. Peirce's nontenured position at Hopkins was the only academic appointment he ever held.\n\nBrent documents something Peirce never suspected, namely that his efforts to obtain academic employment, grants, and scientific respectability were repeatedly frustrated by the covert opposition of a major Canadian-American scientist of the day, Simon Newcomb. Peirce's efforts may also have been hampered by what Brent characterizes as his difficult personality. Conversely, Keith Devlin believes that Peirce's work was too far ahead of his time to be appreciated by the academic establishment of the day and that this played a large role in his inability to obtain a tenured position.\n\nPeirce's personal life undoubtedly worked against his professional success. After his first wife, Harriet Melusina Fay (\"Zina\"), left him in 1875, Peirce, while still legally married, became involved with Juliette, whose last name, given variously as Froissy and Pourtalai, and nationality (she spoke French) remain uncertain. When his divorce from Zina became final in 1883, he married Juliette. That year, Newcomb pointed out to a Johns Hopkins trustee that Peirce, while a Hopkins employee, had lived and traveled with a woman to whom he was not married; the ensuing scandal led to his dismissal in January 1884. Over the years Peirce sought academic employment at various universities without success. He had no children by either marriage.\n\nIn 1887 Peirce spent part of his inheritance from his parents to buy of rural land near Milford, Pennsylvania, which never yielded an economic return. There he had an 1854 farmhouse remodeled to his design. The Peirces named the property \"Arisbe\". There they lived with few interruptions for the rest of their lives, Charles writing prolifically, much of it unpublished to this day (see Works). Living beyond their means soon led to grave financial and legal difficulties. He spent much of his last two decades unable to afford heat in winter and subsisting on old bread donated by the local baker. Unable to afford new stationery, he wrote on the verso side of old manuscripts. An outstanding warrant for assault and unpaid debts led to his being a fugitive in New York City for a while. Several people, including his brother James Mills Peirce and his neighbors, relatives of Gifford Pinchot, settled his debts and paid his property taxes and mortgage.\n\nPeirce did some scientific and engineering consulting and wrote much for meager pay, mainly encyclopedic dictionary entries, and reviews for \"The Nation\" (with whose editor, Wendell Phillips Garrison, he became friendly). He did translations for the Smithsonian Institution, at its director Samuel Langley's instigation. Peirce also did substantial mathematical calculations for Langley's research on powered flight. Hoping to make money, Peirce tried inventing. He began but did not complete a number of books. In 1888, President Grover Cleveland appointed him to the Assay Commission.\n\nFrom 1890 on, he had a friend and admirer in Judge Francis C. Russell of Chicago, who introduced Peirce to editor Paul Carus and owner Edward C. Hegeler of the pioneering American philosophy journal \"The Monist\", which eventually published at least 14 articles by Peirce. He wrote many texts in James Mark Baldwin's \"Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology\" (1901–5); half of those credited to him appear to have been written actually by Christine Ladd-Franklin under his supervision. He applied in 1902 to the newly formed Carnegie Institution for a grant to write a systematic book of his life's work. The application was doomed; his nemesis Newcomb served on the Institution's executive committee, and its President had been the President of Johns Hopkins at the time of Peirce's dismissal.\n\nThe one who did the most to help Peirce in these desperate times was his old friend William James, dedicating his \"Will to Believe\" (1897) to Peirce, and arranging for Peirce to be paid to give two series of lectures at or near Harvard (1898 and 1903). Most important, each year from 1907 until James's death in 1910, James wrote to his friends in the Boston intelligentsia to request financial aid for Peirce; the fund continued even after James died. Peirce reciprocated by designating James's eldest son as his heir should Juliette predecease him. It has been believed that this was also why Peirce used \"Santiago\" (\"St. James\" in English) as a middle name, but he appeared in print as early as 1890 as Charles Santiago Peirce. (See Charles Santiago Sanders Peirce for discussion and references).\n\nPeirce died destitute in Milford, Pennsylvania, twenty years before his widow.\n\nPeirce grew up in a home where the supremacy of the white Anglo-Saxon male was taken for granted, Irish immigrants were considered inferior and Negro slavery was considered natural.\n\nUntil the outbreak of the Civil War his father described himself as a secessionist, but after the outbreak of the war, this stopped and he became a Union partisan, providing donations to the Sanitary Commission, the leading Northern war charity. No members of the Peirce family volunteered or enlisted.\nPeirce shared his father's views and liked to use the syllogism to illustrate the unreliability of traditional forms of logic. \"See: Peirce's law#Other proofs of Peirce's law\".\n\n<poem>\nAll Men are equal in their political rights.\nNegroes are Men.\nTherefore, negroes are equal in political rights to whites.\n</poem>\n\nBertrand Russell (1959) wrote, \"Beyond doubt [...] he was one of the most original minds of the later nineteenth century, and certainly the greatest American thinker ever.\" (Russell and Whitehead's \"Principia Mathematica\", published from 1910 to 1913, does not mention Peirce; Peirce's work was not widely known until later.) A. N. Whitehead, while reading some of Peirce's unpublished manuscripts soon after arriving at Harvard in 1924, was struck by how Peirce had anticipated his own \"process\" thinking. (On Peirce and process metaphysics, see Lowe 1964.) Karl Popper viewed Peirce as \"one of the greatest philosophers of all times\". Yet Peirce's achievements were not immediately recognized. His imposing contemporaries William James and Josiah Royce admired him, and Cassius Jackson Keyser at Columbia and C. K. Ogden wrote about Peirce with respect, but to no immediate effect.\n\nThe first scholar to give Peirce his considered professional attention was Royce's student Morris Raphael Cohen, the editor of an anthology of Peirce's writings titled \"Chance, Love, and Logic\" (1923) and the author of the first bibliography of Peirce's scattered writings. John Dewey studied under Peirce at Johns Hopkins and, from 1916 onward, Dewey's writings repeatedly mention Peirce with deference. His 1938 \"Logic: The Theory of Inquiry\" is much influenced by Peirce. The publication of the first six volumes of \"Collected Papers\" (1931–35), the most important event to date in Peirce studies and one that Cohen made possible by raising the needed funds, did not prompt an outpouring of secondary studies. The editors of those volumes, Charles Hartshorne and Paul Weiss, did not become Peirce specialists. Early landmarks of the secondary literature include the monographs by Buchler (1939), Feibleman (1946), and Goudge (1950), the 1941 Ph.D. thesis by Arthur W. Burks (who went on to edit volumes 7 and 8), and the studies edited by Wiener and Young (1952). The Charles S. Peirce Society was founded in 1946. Its \"Transactions\", an academic quarterly specializing in Peirce, pragmatism, and American philosophy, has appeared since 1965. (See Phillips 2014, 62 for discussion of Peirce and Dewey relative to transactionalism).\n\nIn 1949, while doing unrelated archival work, the historian of mathematics Carolyn Eisele (1902–2000) chanced on an autograph letter by Peirce. So began her 40 years of research on Peirce the mathematician and scientist, culminating in Eisele (1976, 1979, 1985). Beginning around 1960, the philosopher and historian of ideas Max Fisch (1900–1995) emerged as an authority on Peirce; Fisch (1986) includes many of his relevant articles, including a wide-ranging survey (Fisch 1986: 422–48) of the impact of Peirce's thought through 1983.\n\nPeirce has gained a significant international following, marked by university research centers devoted to Peirce studies and pragmatism in Brazil (CeneP/CIEP), Finland (HPRC and ), Germany (Wirth's group, Hoffman's and Otte's group, and Deuser's and Härle's group), France (L'I.R.S.C.E.), Spain (GEP), and Italy (CSP). His writings have been translated into several languages, including German, French, Finnish, Spanish, and Swedish. Since 1950, there have been French, Italian, Spanish, British, and Brazilian Peirceans of note. For many years, the North American philosophy department most devoted to Peirce was the University of Toronto's, thanks in good part to the leadership of Thomas Goudge and David Savan. In recent years, U.S. Peirce scholars have clustered at Indiana University - Purdue University Indianapolis, home of the Peirce Edition Project (PEP), and the Pennsylvania State University.\n\nIn recent years, Peirce's trichotomy of signs is exploited by a growing number of practitioners for marketing and design tasks.\n\nPeirce's reputation rests largely on a number of academic papers published in American scientific and scholarly journals such as \"Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences\", the \"Journal of Speculative Philosophy\", \"The Monist\", \"Popular Science Monthly\", the \"American Journal of Mathematics\", \"Memoirs of the National Academy of Sciences\", \"The Nation\", and others. See Articles by Peirce, published in his lifetime for an extensive list with links to them online. The only full-length book (neither extract nor pamphlet) that Peirce authored and saw published in his lifetime was \"Photometric Researches\" (1878), a 181-page monograph on the applications of spectrographic methods to astronomy. While at Johns Hopkins, he edited \"Studies in Logic\" (1883), containing chapters by himself and his graduate students. Besides lectures during his years (1879–1884) as Lecturer in Logic at Johns Hopkins, he gave at least nine series of lectures, many now published; see Lectures by Peirce.\n\nHarvard University obtained from Peirce's widow soon after his death the papers found in his study, but did not microfilm them until 1964. Only after Richard Robin (1967) catalogued this \"Nachlass\" did it become clear that Peirce had left approximately 1650 unpublished manuscripts, totaling over 100,000 pages, mostly still unpublished except on microfilm. On the vicissitudes of Peirce's papers, see Houser (1989). Reportedly the papers remain in unsatisfactory condition.\n\nThe first published anthology of Peirce's articles was the one-volume \"Chance, Love and Logic: Philosophical Essays\", edited by Morris Raphael Cohen, 1923, still in print. Other one-volume anthologies were published in 1940, 1957, 1958, 1972, 1994, and 2009, most still in print. The main posthumous editions of Peirce's works in their long trek to light, often multi-volume, and some still in print, have included:\n\n1931–58: \"Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce\" (CP), 8 volumes, includes many published works, along with a selection of previously unpublished work and a smattering of his correspondence. This long-time standard edition drawn from Peirce's work from the 1860s to 1913 remains the most comprehensive survey of his prolific output from 1893 to 1913. It is organized thematically, but texts (including lecture series) are often split up across volumes, while texts from various stages in Peirce's development are often combined, requiring frequent visits to editors' notes. Edited (1–6) by Charles Hartshorne and Paul Weiss and (7–8) by Arthur Burks, in print and online.\n\n1975–87: \"Charles Sanders Peirce: Contributions to\" The Nation, 4 volumes, includes Peirce's more than 300 reviews and articles published 1869–1908 in \"The Nation\". Edited by Kenneth Laine Ketner and James Edward Cook, online.\n\n1976: \"The New Elements of Mathematics by Charles S. Peirce\", 4 volumes in 5, included many previously unpublished Peirce manuscripts on mathematical subjects, along with Peirce's important published mathematical articles. Edited by Carolyn Eisele, back in print.\n\n1977: \"Semiotic and Significs: The Correspondence between C. S. Peirce and Victoria Lady Welby\" (2nd edition 2001), included Peirce's entire correspondence (1903–1912) with Victoria, Lady Welby. Peirce's other published correspondence is largely limited to the 14 letters included in volume 8 of the \"Collected Papers\", and the 20-odd pre-1890 items included so far in the \"Writings\". Edited by Charles S. Hardwick with James Cook, out of print.\n\n1982–now: \"Writings of Charles S. Peirce, A Chronological Edition\" (W), Volumes 1–6 & 8, of a projected 30. The limited coverage, and defective editing and organization, of the \"Collected Papers\" led Max Fisch and others in the 1970s to found the Peirce Edition Project (PEP), whose mission is to prepare a more complete critical chronological edition. Only seven volumes have appeared to date, but they cover the period from 1859–1892, when Peirce carried out much of his best-known work. W 8 was published in November 2010; and work continues on W 7, 9, and 11. In print and online.\n\n1985: \"Historical Perspectives on Peirce's Logic of Science: A History of Science\", 2 volumes. Auspitz has said, \"The extent of Peirce's immersion in the science of his day is evident in his reviews in the \"Nation\" [...] and in his papers, grant applications, and publishers' prospectuses in the history and practice of science\", referring latterly to \"Historical Perspectives\". Edited by Carolyn Eisele, back in print.\n\n1992: \"Reasoning and the Logic of Things\" collects in one place Peirce's 1898 series of lectures invited by William James. Edited by Kenneth Laine Ketner, with commentary by Hilary Putnam, in print.\n\n1992–98: \"The Essential Peirce\" (EP), 2 volumes, is an important recent sampler of Peirce's philosophical writings. Edited (1) by Nathan Hauser and Christian Kloesel and (2) by PEP editors, in print.\n\n1997: \"Pragmatism as a Principle and Method of Right Thinking\" collects Peirce's 1903 Harvard \"Lectures on Pragmatism\" in a study edition, including drafts, of Peirce's lecture manuscripts, which had been previously published in abridged form; the lectures now also appear in EP 2. Edited by Patricia Ann Turisi, in print.\n\n2010: \"Philosophy of Mathematics: Selected Writings\" collects important writings by Peirce on the subject, many not previously in print. Edited by Matthew E. Moore, in print.\n\nPeirce's most important work in pure mathematics was in logical and foundational areas. He also worked on linear algebra, matrices, various geometries, topology and Listing numbers, Bell numbers, graphs, the four-color problem, and the nature of continuity.\n\nHe worked on applied mathematics in economics, engineering, and map projections (such as the Peirce quincuncial projection), and was especially active in probability and statistics.\n\n\nPeirce made a number of striking discoveries in formal logic and foundational mathematics, nearly all of which came to be appreciated only long after he died:\n\nIn 1860 he suggested a cardinal arithmetic for infinite numbers, years before any work by Georg Cantor (who completed his dissertation in 1867) and without access to Bernard Bolzano's 1851 (posthumous) \"Paradoxien des Unendlichen\".\n\nIn 1880–81 he showed how Boolean algebra could be done via a repeated sufficient single binary operation (logical NOR), anticipating Henry M. Sheffer by 33 years. (See also De Morgan's Laws).\n\nIn 1881 he set out the axiomatization of natural number arithmetic, a few years before Richard Dedekind and Giuseppe Peano. In the same paper Peirce gave, years before Dedekind, the first purely cardinal definition of a finite set in the sense now known as \"Dedekind-finite\", and implied by the same stroke an important formal definition of an infinite set (Dedekind-infinite), as a set that can be put into a one-to-one correspondence with one of its proper subsets.\n\nIn 1885 he distinguished between first-order and second-order quantification. In the same paper he set out what can be read as the first (primitive) axiomatic set theory, anticipating Zermelo by about two decades (Brady 2000, pp. 132–3).\n\nIn 1886, he saw that Boolean calculations could be carried out via electrical switches, anticipating Claude Shannon by more than 50 years. \nBy the later 1890s he was devising existential graphs, a diagrammatic notation for the predicate calculus. Based on them are John F. Sowa's conceptual graphs and Sun-Joo Shin's diagrammatic reasoning.\n\n\nPeirce wrote drafts for an introductory textbook, with the working title \"The New Elements of Mathematics\", that presented mathematics from an original standpoint. Those drafts and many other of his previously unpublished mathematical manuscripts finally appeared in \"The New Elements of Mathematics by Charles S. Peirce\" (1976), edited by mathematician Carolyn Eisele.\n\n\nPeirce agreed with Auguste Comte in regarding mathematics as more basic than philosophy and the special sciences (of nature and mind). Peirce classified mathematics into three subareas: (1) mathematics of logic, (2) discrete series, and (3) pseudo-continua (as he called them, including the real numbers) and continua. Influenced by his father Benjamin, Peirce argued that mathematics studies purely hypothetical objects and is not just the science of quantity but is more broadly the science which draws necessary conclusions; that mathematics aids logic, not vice versa; and that logic itself is part of philosophy and is the science \"about\" drawing conclusions necessary and otherwise.\n\n Beginning with his first paper on the \"Logic of Relatives\" (1870), Peirce extended the theory of relations that Augustus De Morgan had just recently awakened from its Cinderella slumbers. Much of the mathematics of relations now taken for granted was \"borrowed\" from Peirce, not always with all due credit; on that and on how the young Bertrand Russell, especially his \"Principles of Mathematics\" and \"Principia Mathematica\", did not do Peirce justice, see Anellis (1995). In 1918 the logician C. I. Lewis wrote, \"The contributions of C.S. Peirce to symbolic logic are more numerous and varied than those of any other writer—at least in the nineteenth century.\" Beginning in 1940, Alfred Tarski and his students rediscovered aspects of Peirce's larger vision of relational logic, developing the perspective of relation algebra.\n\nRelational logic gained applications. In mathematics, it influenced the abstract analysis of E. H. Moore and the lattice theory of Garrett Birkhoff. In computer science, the relational model for databases was developed with Peircean ideas in work of Edgar F. Codd, who was a doctoral student of Arthur W. Burks, a Peirce scholar. In economics, relational logic was used by Frank P. Ramsey, John von Neumann, and Paul Samuelson to study preferences and utility and by Kenneth J. Arrow in \"Social Choice and Individual Values\", following Arrow's association with Tarski at City College of New York.\n\nOn Peirce and his contemporaries Ernst Schröder and Gottlob Frege, Hilary Putnam (1982) documented that Frege's work on the logic of quantifiers had little influence on his contemporaries, although it was published four years before the work of Peirce and his student Oscar Howard Mitchell. Putnam found that mathematicians and logicians learned about the logic of quantifiers through the independent work of Peirce and Mitchell, particularly through Peirce's \"On the Algebra of Logic: A Contribution to the Philosophy of Notation\" (1885), published in the premier American mathematical journal of the day, and cited by Peano and Schröder, among others, who ignored Frege. They also adopted and modified Peirce's notations, typographical variants of those now used. Peirce apparently was ignorant of Frege's work, despite their overlapping achievements in logic, philosophy of language, and the foundations of mathematics.\n\nPeirce's work on formal logic had admirers besides Ernst Schröder:\n\nA philosophy of logic, grounded in his categories and semiotic, can be extracted from Peirce's writings and, along with Peirce's logical work more generally, is exposited and defended in Hilary Putnam (1982); the Introduction in Nathan Houser \"et al.\" (1997); and Randall Dipert's chapter in Cheryl Misak (2004).\n\nContinuity and synechism are central in Peirce's philosophy: \"I did not at first suppose that it was, as I gradually came to find it, the master-Key of philosophy\".\n\nFrom a mathematical point of view, he embraced infinitesimals and worked long on the mathematics of continua. He long held that the real numbers constitute a pseudo-continuum; that a true continuum is the real subject matter of \"analysis situs\" (topology); and that a true continuum of instants exceeds—and within any lapse of time has room for—any Aleph number (any infinite \"multitude\" as he called it) of instants.\n\nIn 1908 Peirce wrote that he found that a true continuum might have or lack such room. Jérôme Havenel (2008): \"It is on May 26, 1908, that Peirce finally gave up his idea that in every continuum there is room for whatever collection of any multitude. From now on, there are different kinds of continua, which have different properties.\"\n\nPeirce held that science achieves statistical probabilities, not certainties, and that spontaneity (absolute chance) is real (see Tychism on his view). Most of his statistical writings promote the frequency interpretation of probability (objective ratios of cases), and many of his writings express skepticism about (and criticize the use of) probability when such models are not based on objective randomization. Though Peirce was largely a frequentist, his possible world semantics introduced the \"propensity\" theory of probability before Karl Popper. Peirce (sometimes with Joseph Jastrow) investigated the probability judgments of experimental subjects, \"perhaps the very first\" elicitation and estimation of subjective probabilities in experimental psychology and (what came to be called) Bayesian statistics.\n\nPeirce was one of the founders of statistics. He formulated modern statistics in \"Illustrations of the Logic of Science\" (1877–8) and \"A Theory of Probable Inference\" (1883). With a repeated measures design, Charles Sanders Peirce and Joseph Jastrow introduced blinded, controlled randomized experiments in 1884 (Hacking 1990:205) (before Ronald A. Fisher). He invented optimal design for experiments on gravity, in which he \"corrected the means\". He used correlation and smoothing. Peirce extended the work on outliers by Benjamin Peirce, his father. He introduced terms \"confidence\" and \"likelihood\" (before Jerzy Neyman and Fisher). (See Stephen Stigler's historical books and Ian Hacking 1990).\n\nPeirce was a working scientist for 30 years, and arguably was a professional philosopher only during the five years he lectured at Johns Hopkins. He learned philosophy mainly by reading, each day, a few pages of Kant's \"Critique of Pure Reason\", in the original German, while a Harvard undergraduate. His writings bear on a wide array of disciplines, including mathematics, logic, philosophy, statistics, astronomy, metrology, geodesy, experimental psychology, economics, linguistics, and the history and philosophy of science. This work has enjoyed renewed interest and approval, a revival inspired not only by his anticipations of recent scientific developments but also by his demonstration of how philosophy can be applied effectively to human problems.\n\nPeirce's philosophy includes (see below in related sections) a pervasive three-category system, belief that truth is immutable and is both independent from actual opinion (fallibilism) and discoverable (no radical skepticism), logic as formal semiotic on signs, on arguments, and on inquiry's ways—including philosophical pragmatism (which he founded), critical common-sensism, and scientific method—and, in metaphysics: Scholastic realism, e.g. John Duns Scotus, belief in God, freedom, and at least an attenuated immortality, objective idealism, and belief in the reality of continuity and of absolute chance, mechanical necessity, and creative love. In his work, fallibilism and pragmatism may seem to work somewhat like skepticism and positivism, respectively, in others' work. However, for Peirce, fallibilism is balanced by an anti-skepticism and is a basis for belief in the reality of absolute chance and of continuity, and pragmatism commits one to anti-nominalist belief in the reality of the general (CP 5.453–7).\n\nFor Peirce, First Philosophy, which he also called cenoscopy, is less basic than mathematics and more basic than the special sciences (of nature and mind). It studies positive phenomena in general, phenomena available to any person at any waking moment, and does not settle questions by resorting to special experiences. He divided such philosophy into (1) phenomenology (which he also called phaneroscopy or categorics), (2) normative sciences (esthetics, ethics, and logic), and (3) metaphysics; his views on them are discussed in order below.\n\nOn May 14, 1867, the 27-year-old Peirce presented a paper entitled \"On a New List of Categories\" to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, which published it the following year. The paper outlined a theory of predication, involving three universal categories that Peirce developed in response to reading Aristotle, Kant, and Hegel, categories that Peirce applied throughout his work for the rest of his life. Peirce scholars generally regard the \"New List\" as foundational or breaking the ground for Peirce's \"architectonic\", his blueprint for a pragmatic philosophy. In the categories one will discern, concentrated, the pattern that one finds formed by the three grades of clearness in \"\" (1878 paper foundational to pragmatism), and in numerous other trichotomies in his work.\n\n\"On a New List of Categories\" is cast as a Kantian deduction; it is short but dense and difficult to summarize. The following table is compiled from that and later works. In 1893, Peirce restated most of it for a less advanced audience. \n\nPeirce did not write extensively in aesthetics and ethics, but came by 1902 to hold that aesthetics, ethics, and logic, in that order, comprise the normative sciences. He characterized aesthetics as the study of the good (grasped as the admirable), and thus of the ends governing all conduct and thought.\n\nPeirce regarded logic \"per se\" as a division of philosophy, as a normative science based on esthetics and ethics, as more basic than metaphysics, and as \"the art of devising methods of research\". More generally, as inference, \"logic is rooted in the social principle\", since inference depends on a standpoint that, in a sense, is unlimited. Peirce called (with no sense of deprecation) \"mathematics of logic\" much of the kind of thing which, in current research and applications, is called simply \"logic\". He was productive in both (philosophical) logic and logic's mathematics, which were connected deeply in his work and thought.\n\nPeirce argued that logic is formal semiotic, the formal study of signs in the broadest sense, not only signs that are artificial, linguistic, or symbolic, but also signs that are semblances or are indexical such as reactions. Peirce held that \"all this universe is perfused with signs, if it is not composed exclusively of signs\", along with their representational and inferential relations. He argued that, since all thought takes time, all thought is in signs and sign processes (\"semiosis\") such as the inquiry process. He divided logic into: (1) speculative grammar, or stechiology, on how signs can be meaningful and, in relation to that, what kinds of signs there are, how they combine, and how some embody or incorporate others; (2) logical critic, or logic proper, on the modes of inference; and (3) speculative or universal rhetoric, or methodeutic, the philosophical theory of inquiry, including pragmatism.\n\nIn his \"F.R.L.\" [First Rule of Logic] (1899), Peirce states that the first, and \"in one sense, the sole\", rule of reason is that, \"to learn, one needs to desire to learn\" and desire it without resting satisfied with that which one is inclined to think. So, the first rule is, \"to wonder\". Peirce proceeds to a critical theme in research practices and the shaping of theories:\nDo not block the way of inquiry.\nPeirce adds, that method and economy are best in research but no outright sin inheres in trying any theory in the sense that the investigation via its trial adoption can proceed unimpeded and undiscouraged, and that \"the one unpardonable offence\" is a philosophical barricade against truth's advance, an offense to which \"metaphysicians in all ages have shown themselves the most addicted\". Peirce in many writings holds that logic precedes metaphysics (ontological, religious, and physical).\n\nPeirce goes on to list four common barriers to inquiry: (1) Assertion of absolute certainty; (2) maintaining that something is absolutely unknowable; (3) maintaining that something is absolutely inexplicable because absolutely basic or ultimate; (4) holding that perfect exactitude is possible, especially such as to quite preclude unusual and anomalous phenomena. To refuse absolute theoretical certainty is the heart of \"fallibilism\", which Peirce unfolds into refusals to set up any of the listed barriers. Peirce elsewhere argues (1897) that logic's presupposition of fallibilism leads at length to the view that chance and continuity are very real (tychism and synechism).\n\nThe First Rule of Logic pertains to the mind's presuppositions in undertaking reason and logic, presuppositions, for instance, that truth and the real do not depend on yours or my opinion of them but do depend on representational relation and consist in the destined end in investigation taken far enough (see below). He describes such ideas as, collectively, hopes which, in particular cases, one is unable seriously to doubt.\n\n In three articles in 1868–69, Peirce rejected mere verbal or hyperbolic doubt and first or ultimate principles, and argued that we have (as he numbered them):\n(The above sense of the term \"intuition\" is almost Kant's, said Peirce. It differs from the current looser sense that encompasses instinctive or anyway half-conscious inference.)\n\nPeirce argued that those incapacities imply the reality of the general and of the continuous, the validity of the modes of reasoning, and the falsity of philosophical Cartesianism (see below).\n\nPeirce rejected the conception (usually ascribed to Kant) of the unknowable thing-in-itself and later said that to \"dismiss make-believes\" is a prerequisite for pragmatism.\n\nPeirce sought, through his wide-ranging studies through the decades, formal philosophical ways to articulate thought's processes, and also to explain the workings of science. These inextricably entangled questions of a dynamics of inquiry rooted in nature and nurture led him to develop his semiotic with very broadened conceptions of signs and inference, and, as its culmination, a theory of inquiry for the task of saying 'how science works' and devising research methods. This would be logic by the medieval definition taught for centuries: art of arts, science of sciences, having the way to the principles of all methods. Influences radiate from points on parallel lines of inquiry in Aristotle's work, in such \"loci\" as: the basic terminology of psychology in \"On the Soul\"; the founding description of sign relations in \"On Interpretation\"; and the differentiation of inference into three modes that are commonly translated into English as \"abduction\", \"deduction\", and \"induction\", in the \"Prior Analytics\", as well as inference by analogy (called \"paradeigma\" by Aristotle), which Peirce regarded as involving the other three modes.\n\nPeirce began writing on semiotic in the 1860s, around the time when he devised his system of three categories. He called it both \"semiotic\" and \"semeiotic\". Both are current in singular and plural. He based it on the conception of a triadic sign relation, and defined \"semiosis\" as \"action, or influence, which is, or involves, a cooperation of \"three\" subjects, such as a sign, its object, and its interpretant, this tri-relative influence not being in any way resolvable into actions between pairs\". As to signs in thought, Peirce emphasized the reverse:\nPeirce held that all thought is in signs, issuing in and from interpretation, where 'sign' is the word for the broadest variety of conceivable semblances, diagrams, metaphors, symptoms, signals, designations, symbols, texts, even mental concepts and ideas, all as determinations of a mind or \"quasi-mind\", that which at least functions like a mind, as in the work of crystals or bees — the focus is on sign action in general rather than on psychology, linguistics, or social studies (fields which he also pursued).\n\nInquiry is a kind of inference process, a manner of thinking and semiosis. Global divisions of ways for phenomena to stand as signs, and the subsumption of inquiry and thinking within inference as a sign process, enable the study of inquiry on semiotics' three levels:\n\n\nPeirce uses examples often from common experience, but defines and discusses such things as assertion and interpretation in terms of philosophical logic. In a formal vein, Peirce said:\n\nPeirce's theory of signs is known to be one of the most complex semiotic theories due to its generalistic claim. Anything is a sign — not absolutely as itself, but instead in some relation or other. The \"sign relation\" is the key. It defines three roles encompassing (1) the sign, (2) the sign's subject matter, called its \"object\", and (3) the sign's meaning or ramification as formed into a kind of effect called its \"interpretant\" (a further sign, for example a translation). It is an irreducible \"triadic relation\", according to Peirce. The roles are distinct even when the things that fill those roles are not. The roles are but three; a sign of an object leads to one or more interpretants, and, as signs, they lead to further interpretants.\n\n\"Extension × intension = information.\" Two traditional approaches to sign relation, necessary though insufficient, are the way of \"extension\" (a sign's objects, also called breadth, denotation, or application) and the way of \"intension\" (the objects' characteristics, qualities, attributes referenced by the sign, also called depth, comprehension, significance, or connotation). Peirce adds a third, the way of \"information\", including change of information, to integrate the other two approaches into a unified whole. For example, because of the equation above, if a term's total amount of information stays the same, then the more that the term 'intends' or signifies about objects, the fewer are the objects to which the term 'extends' or applies.\n\n\"Determination.\" A sign depends on its object in such a way as to represent its object — the object enables and, in a sense, determines the sign. A physically causal sense of this stands out when a sign consists in an indicative reaction. The interpretant depends likewise on both the sign and the object — an object determines a sign to determine an interpretant. But this determination is not a succession of dyadic events, like a row of toppling dominoes; sign determination is triadic. For example, an interpretant does not merely represent something which represented an object; instead an interpretant represents something \"as\" a sign representing the object. The object (be it a quality or fact or law or even fictional) determines the sign to an interpretant through one's collateral experience with the object, in which the object is found or from which it is recalled, as when a sign consists in a chance semblance of an absent object. Peirce used the word \"determine\" not in a strictly deterministic sense, but in a sense of \"specializes,\" \"bestimmt\", involving variable amount, like an influence. Peirce came to define representation and interpretation in terms of (triadic) determination. The object determines the sign to determine another sign — the interpretant — to be related to the object \"as the sign is related to the object\", hence the interpretant, fulfilling its function as sign of the object, determines a further interpretant sign. The process is logically structured to perpetuate itself, and is definitive of sign, object, and interpretant in general.\n\nPeirce held there are exactly three basic elements in semiosis (sign action):\nSome of the understanding needed by the mind depends on familiarity with the object. To know what a given sign denotes, the mind needs some experience of that sign's object, experience outside of, and collateral to, that sign or sign system. In that context Peirce speaks of collateral experience, collateral observation, collateral acquaintance, all in much the same terms.\n\nAmong Peirce's many sign typologies, three stand out, interlocked. The first typology depends on the sign itself, the second on how the sign stands for its denoted object, and the third on how the sign stands for its object to its interpretant. Also, each of the three typologies is a three-way division, a trichotomy, via Peirce's three phenomenological categories: (1) quality of feeling, (2) reaction, resistance, and (3) representation, mediation.\n\nI. \"Qualisign, sinsign, legisign\" (also called\" tone, token, type,\" and also called \"potisign, actisign, famisign\"): This typology classifies every sign according to the sign's own phenomenological category—the qualisign is a quality, a possibility, a \"First\"; the sinsign is a reaction or resistance, a singular object, an actual event or fact, a \"Second\"; and the legisign is a habit, a rule, a representational relation, a \"Third\".\n\nII. \"Icon, index, symbol\": This typology, the best known one, classifies every sign according to the category of the sign's way of denoting its object—the icon (also called semblance or likeness) by a quality of its own, the index by factual connection to its object, and the symbol by a habit or rule for its interpretant.\n\nIII. \"Rheme, dicisign, argument\" (also called \"sumisign, dicisign, suadisign,\" also \"seme, pheme, delome,\" and regarded as very broadened versions of the traditional \"term, proposition, argument\"): This typology classifies every sign according to the category which the interpretant attributes to the sign's way of denoting its object—the rheme, for example a term, is a sign interpreted to represent its object in respect of quality; the dicisign, for example a proposition, is a sign interpreted to represent its object in respect of fact; and the argument is a sign interpreted to represent its object in respect of habit or law. This is the culminating typology of the three, where the sign is understood as a structural element of inference.\n\nEvery sign belongs to one class or another within (I) \"and\" within (II) \"and\" within (III). Thus each of the three typologies is a three-valued parameter for every sign. The three parameters are not independent of each other; many co-classifications are absent, for reasons pertaining to the lack of either habit-taking or singular reaction in a quality, and the lack of habit-taking in a singular reaction. The result is not 27 but instead ten classes of signs fully specified at this level of analysis.\n\nBorrowing a brace of concepts from Aristotle, Peirce examined three basic modes of inference—\"abduction\", \"deduction\", and \"induction\"—in his \"critique of arguments\" or \"logic proper\". Peirce also called abduction \"retroduction\", \"presumption\", and, earliest of all, \"hypothesis\". He characterized it as guessing and as inference to an explanatory hypothesis. He sometimes expounded the modes of inference by transformations of the categorical syllogism Barbara (AAA), for example in \"Deduction, Induction, and Hypothesis\" (1878). He does this by rearranging the \"rule\" (Barbara's major premise), the \"case\" (Barbara's minor premise), and the \"result\" (Barbara's conclusion):\n\nDeduction.\n\n\"Rule:\" All the beans from this bag are white. <br>\n\"Case:\" These beans are beans from this bag. <br>\nformula_1 \"Result:\" These beans are white.\n\nInduction.\n\n\"Case:\" These beans are [randomly selected] from this bag. <br>\n\"Result:\" These beans are white. <br>\nformula_1 \"Rule:\" All the beans from this bag are white.\n\nHypothesis (Abduction).\n\n\"Rule:\" All the beans from this bag are white. <br>\n\"Result:\" These beans [oddly] are white. <br>\nformula_1 \"Case:\" These beans are from this bag.\nPeirce 1883 in \"A Theory of Probable Inference\" (\"Studies in Logic\") equated hypothetical inference with the induction of characters of objects (as he had done in effect before). Eventually dissatisfied, by 1900 he distinguished them once and for all and also wrote that he now took the syllogistic forms and the doctrine of logical extension and comprehension as being less basic than he had thought. In 1903 he presented the following logical form for abductive inference:\n\nThe logical form does not also cover induction, since induction neither depends on surprise nor proposes a new idea for its conclusion. Induction seeks facts to test a hypothesis; abduction seeks a hypothesis to account for facts. \"Deduction proves that something \"must\" be; Induction shows that something \"actually is\" operative; Abduction merely suggests that something \"may be\".\" Peirce did not remain quite convinced that one logical form covers all abduction. In his methodeutic or theory of inquiry (see below), he portrayed abduction as an economic initiative to further inference and study, and portrayed all three modes as clarified by their coordination in essential roles in inquiry: hypothetical explanation, deductive prediction, inductive testing.\n\n Peirce's recipe for pragmatic thinking, which he called \"pragmatism\" and, later, \"pragmaticism\", is recapitulated in several versions of the so-called \"pragmatic maxim\". Here is one of his more emphatic reiterations of it:\n\nAs a movement, pragmatism began in the early 1870s in discussions among Peirce, William James, and others in the Metaphysical Club. James among others regarded some articles by Peirce such as \"\" (1877) and especially \"\" (1878) as foundational to pragmatism. Peirce (CP 5.11–12), like James (\"\", 1907), saw pragmatism as embodying familiar attitudes, in philosophy and elsewhere, elaborated into a new deliberate method for fruitful thinking about problems. Peirce differed from James and the early John Dewey, in some of their tangential enthusiasms, in being decidedly more rationalistic and realistic, in several senses of those terms, throughout the preponderance of his own philosophical moods.\n\nIn 1905 Peirce coined the new name pragmaticism \"for the precise purpose of expressing the original definition\", saying that \"all went happily\" with James's and F.C.S. Schiller's variant uses of the old name \"pragmatism\" and that he coined the new name because of the old name's growing use in \"literary journals, where it gets abused\". Yet he cited as causes, in a 1906 manuscript, his differences with James and Schiller and, in a 1908 publication, his differences with James as well as literary author Giovanni Papini's declaration of pragmatism's indefinability. Peirce in any case regarded his views that truth is immutable and infinity is real, as being opposed by the other pragmatists, but he remained allied with them on other issues.\n\nPragmatism begins with the idea that belief is that on which one is prepared to act. Peirce's pragmatism is a method of clarification of conceptions of objects. It equates any conception of an object to a conception of that object's effects to a general extent of the effects' conceivable implications for informed practice. It is a method of sorting out conceptual confusions occasioned, for example, by distinctions that make (sometimes needed) formal yet not practical differences. He formulated both pragmatism and statistical principles as aspects of scientific logic, in his \"Illustrations of the Logic of Science\" series of articles. In the second one, \"\", Peirce discussed three grades of clearness of conception:\n\nBy way of example of how to clarify conceptions, he addressed conceptions about truth and the real as questions of the presuppositions of reasoning in general. In clearness's second grade (the \"nominal\" grade), he defined truth as a sign's correspondence to its object, and the real as the object of such correspondence, such that truth and the real are independent of that which you or I or any actual, definite community of inquirers think. After that needful but confined step, next in clearness's third grade (the pragmatic, practice-oriented grade) he defined truth as that opinion which \"would\" be reached, sooner or later but still inevitably, by research taken far enough, such that the real does depend on that ideal final opinion—a dependence to which he appeals in theoretical arguments elsewhere, for instance for the long-run validity of the rule of induction. Peirce argued that even to argue against the independence and discoverability of truth and the real is to presuppose that there is, about that very question under argument, a truth with just such independence and discoverability.\n\nPeirce said that a conception's meaning consists in \"all general modes of rational conduct\" implied by \"acceptance\" of the conception—that is, if one were to accept, first of all, the conception as true, then what could one conceive to be consequent general modes of rational conduct by all who accept the conception as true?—the whole of such consequent general modes is the whole meaning. His pragmatism does not equate a conception's meaning, its intellectual purport, with the conceived benefit or cost of the conception itself, like a meme (or, say, propaganda), outside the perspective of its being true, nor, since a conception is general, is its meaning equated with any definite set of actual consequences or upshots corroborating or undermining the conception or its worth. His pragmatism also bears no resemblance to \"vulgar\" pragmatism, which misleadingly connotes a ruthless and Machiavellian search for mercenary or political advantage. Instead the pragmatic maxim is the heart of his pragmatism as a method of experimentational mental reflection arriving at conceptions in terms of conceivable confirmatory and disconfirmatory circumstances—a method hospitable to the formation of explanatory hypotheses, and conducive to the use and improvement of verification.\n\nPeirce's pragmatism, as method and theory of definitions and conceptual clearness, is part of his theory of inquiry, which he variously called speculative, general, formal or universal rhetoric or simply methodeutic. He applied his pragmatism as a method throughout his work.\n\nCritical common-sensism, treated by Peirce as a consequence of his pragmatism, is his combination of Thomas Reid's common-sense philosophy with a fallibilism that recognizes that propositions of our more or less vague common sense now indubitable may later come into question, for example because of transformations of our world through science. It includes efforts to work up in tests genuine doubts for a core group of common indubitables that vary slowly if at all.\n\nIn (1877), Peirce described inquiry in general not as the pursuit of truth \"per se\" but as the struggle to move from irritating, inhibitory doubt born of surprise, disagreement, and the like, and to reach a secure belief, belief being that on which one is prepared to act. That let Peirce frame scientific inquiry as part of a broader spectrum and as spurred, like inquiry generally, by actual doubt, not mere verbal, quarrelsome, or hyperbolic doubt, which he held to be fruitless. Peirce sketched four methods of settling opinion, ordered from least to most successful:\n\nPeirce held that, in practical affairs, slow and stumbling ratiocination is often dangerously inferior to instinct and traditional sentiment, and that the scientific method is best suited to theoretical research, which in turn should not be trammeled by the other methods and practical ends; reason's \"first rule\" is that, in order to learn, one must desire to learn and, as a corollary, must not block the way of inquiry. Scientific method excels over the others finally by being deliberately designed to arrive — eventually — at the most secure beliefs, upon which the most successful practices can be based. Starting from the idea that people seek not truth \"per se\" but instead to subdue irritating, inhibitory doubt, Peirce showed how, through the struggle, some can come to submit to truth for the sake of belief's integrity, seek as truth the guidance of potential conduct correctly to its given goal, and wed themselves to the scientific method.\n\nInsofar as clarification by pragmatic reflection suits explanatory hypotheses and fosters predictions and testing, pragmatism points beyond the usual duo of foundational alternatives: deduction from self-evident truths, or \"rationalism\"; and induction from experiential phenomena, or \"empiricism\".\n\nBased on his critique of three modes of argument and different from either foundationalism or coherentism, Peirce's approach seeks to justify claims by a three-phase dynamic of inquiry:\n\n\nThereby, Peirce devised an approach to inquiry far more solid than the flatter image of inductive generalization \"simpliciter\", which is a mere re-labeling of phenomenological patterns. Peirce's pragmatism was the first time the scientific method was proposed as an epistemology for philosophical questions.\n\nA theory that succeeds better than its rivals in predicting and controlling our world is said to be nearer the truth. This is an operational notion of truth used by scientists.\n\nPeirce extracted the pragmatic model or theory of inquiry from its raw materials in classical logic and refined it in parallel with the early development of symbolic logic to address problems about the nature of scientific reasoning.\n\nAbduction, deduction, and induction make incomplete sense in isolation from one another but comprise a cycle understandable as a whole insofar as they collaborate toward the common end of inquiry. In the pragmatic way of thinking about conceivable practical implications, every thing has a purpose, and, as possible, its purpose should first be denoted. Abduction hypothesizes an explanation for deduction to clarify into implications to be tested so that induction can evaluate the hypothesis, in the struggle to move from troublesome uncertainty to more secure belief. No matter how traditional and needful it is to study the modes of inference in abstraction from one another, the integrity of inquiry strongly limits the effective modularity of its principal components.\n\nPeirce's outline of the scientific method in §III–IV of \"A Neglected Argument\" is summarized below (except as otherwise noted). There he also reviewed plausibility and inductive precision (issues of critique of arguments).\n\n1. Abductive (or retroductive) phase. Guessing, inference to explanatory hypotheses for selection of those best worth trying. From abduction, Peirce distinguishes induction as inferring, on the basis of tests, the proportion of truth in the hypothesis. Every inquiry, whether into ideas, brute facts, or norms and laws, arises from surprising observations in one or more of those realms (and for example at any stage of an inquiry already underway). All explanatory content of theories comes from abduction, which guesses a new or outside idea so as to account in a simple, economical way for a surprising or complicated phenomenon. The modicum of success in our guesses far exceeds that of random luck, and seems born of attunement to nature by developed or inherent instincts, especially insofar as best guesses are optimally plausible and simple in the sense of the \"facile and natural\", as by Galileo's natural light of reason and as distinct from \"logical simplicity\". Abduction is the most fertile but least secure mode of inference. Its general rationale is inductive: it succeeds often enough and it has no substitute in expediting us toward new truths. In 1903, Peirce called pragmatism \"the logic of abduction\". Coordinative method leads from abducting a plausible hypothesis to judging it for its testability and for how its trial would economize inquiry itself. The hypothesis, being insecure, needs to have practical implications leading at least to mental tests and, in science, lending themselves to scientific tests. A simple but unlikely guess, if not costly to test for falsity, may belong first in line for testing. A guess is intrinsically worth testing if it has plausibility or reasoned objective probability, while subjective likelihood, though reasoned, can be misleadingly seductive. Guesses can be selected for trial strategically, for their caution (for which Peirce gave as example the game of Twenty Questions), breadth, or incomplexity. One can discover only that which would be revealed through their sufficient experience anyway, and so the point is to expedite it; economy of research demands the leap, so to speak, of abduction and governs its art.\n\n2. Deductive phase. Two stages:\n\n3. Inductive phase. Evaluation of the hypothesis, inferring from observational or experimental tests of its deduced consequences. The long-run validity of the rule of induction is deducible from the principle (presuppositional to reasoning in general) that the real \"is only the object of the final opinion to which sufficient investigation would lead\"; in other words, anything excluding such a process would never be real. Induction involving the ongoing accumulation of evidence follows \"a method which, sufficiently persisted in,\" will \"diminish the error below any predesignate degree.\" Three stages:\n\nPeirce drew on the methodological implications of the four incapacities — no genuine introspection, no intuition in the sense of non-inferential cognition, no thought but in signs, and no conception of the absolutely incognizable — to attack philosophical Cartesianism, of which he said that:\n\n1. \"It teaches that philosophy must begin in universal doubt\" — when, instead, we start with preconceptions, \"prejudices [...] which it does not occur to us \"can\" be questioned\", though we may find reason to question them later. \"Let us not pretend to doubt in philosophy what we do not doubt in our hearts.\"\n\n2. \"It teaches that the ultimate test of certainty is...in the individual consciousness\" — when, instead, in science a theory stays on probation till agreement is reached, then it has no actual doubters left. No lone individual can reasonably hope to fulfill philosophy's multi-generational dream. When \"candid and disciplined minds\" continue to disagree on a theoretical issue, even the theory's author should feel doubts about it.\n\n3. It trusts to \"a single thread of inference depending often upon inconspicuous premisses\" — when, instead, philosophy should, \"like the successful sciences\", proceed only from tangible, scrutinizable premisses and trust not to any one argument but instead to \"the multitude and variety of its arguments\" as forming, not a chain at least as weak as its weakest link, but \"a cable whose fibers\", soever \"slender, are sufficiently numerous and intimately connected\".\n\n4. It renders many facts \"absolutely inexplicable, unless to say that 'God makes them so' is to be regarded as an explanation\" — when, instead, philosophy should avoid being \"unidealistic\", misbelieving that something real can defy or evade all possible ideas, and supposing, inevitably, \"some absolutely inexplicable, unanalyzable ultimate\", which explanatory surmise explains nothing and so is inadmissible.\n\nPeirce divided metaphysics into (1) ontology or general metaphysics, (2) psychical or religious metaphysics, and (3) physical metaphysics.\n\nOntology. Peirce was a Scholastic Realist, declaring for the reality of generals as early as 1868. Regarding modalities (possibility, necessity, etc.), he came in later years to regard himself as having wavered earlier as to just how positively real the modalities are. In his 1897 \"The Logic of Relatives\" he wrote: Peirce retained, as useful for some purposes, the definitions in terms of information states, but insisted that the pragmaticist is committed to a strong modal realism by conceiving of objects in terms of predictive general conditional propositions about how they \"would\" behave under certain circumstances.\n\nPsychical or religious metaphysics. Peirce believed in God, and characterized such belief as founded in an instinct explorable in musing over the worlds of ideas, brute facts, and evolving habits — and it is a belief in God not as an \"actual\" or \"existent\" being (in Peirce's sense of those words), but all the same as a \"real\" being. In \"\" (1908), Peirce sketches, for God's reality, an argument to a hypothesis of God as the Necessary Being, a hypothesis which he describes in terms of how it would tend to develop and become compelling in musement and inquiry by a normal person who is led, by the hypothesis, to consider as being purposed the features of the worlds of ideas, brute facts, and evolving habits (for example scientific progress), such that the thought of such purposefulness will \"stand or fall with the hypothesis\"; meanwhile, according to Peirce, the hypothesis, in supposing an \"infinitely incomprehensible\" being, starts off at odds with its own nature as a purportively true conception, and so, no matter how much the hypothesis grows, it both (A) inevitably regards itself as partly true, partly vague, and as continuing to define itself without limit, and (B) inevitably has God appearing likewise vague but growing, though God as the Necessary Being is not vague or growing; but the hypothesis will hold it to be \"more\" false to say the opposite, that God is purposeless. Peirce also argued that the will is free and (see Synechism) that there is at least an attenuated kind of immortality.\n\nPhysical metaphysics. Peirce held the view, which he called objective idealism, that \"matter is effete mind, inveterate habits becoming physical laws\". Peirce asserted the reality of (1) absolute chance (his tychist view), (2) mechanical necessity (anancist view), and (3) that which he called the law of love (agapist view), echoing his categories Firstness, Secondness, and Thirdness, respectively. He held that fortuitous variation (which he also called \"sporting\"), mechanical necessity, and creative love are the three modes of evolution (modes called \"tychasm\", \"anancasm\", and \"agapasm\") of the cosmos and its parts. He found his conception of agapasm embodied in Lamarckian evolution; the overall idea in any case is that of evolution tending toward an end or goal, and it could also be the evolution of a mind or a society; it is the kind of evolution which manifests workings of mind in some general sense. He said that overall he was a synechist, holding with reality of continuity, especially of space, time, and law.\n\nPeirce outlined two fields, \"Cenoscopy\" and \"Science of Review\", both of which he called philosophy. Both included philosophy about science. In 1903 he arranged them, from more to less theoretically basic, thus:\n\n\nPeirce placed, within Science of Review, the work and theory of classifying the sciences (including mathematics and philosophy). His classifications, on which he worked for many years, draw on argument and wide knowledge, and are of interest both as a map for navigating his philosophy and as an accomplished polymath's survey of research in his time.\n\nContemporaries associated with Peirce\n\n"}
{"id": "6118", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6118", "title": "Carnot heat engine", "text": "Carnot heat engine\n\nA Carnot heat engine is an engine that operates on the reversible Carnot cycle. The basic model for this engine was developed by Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot in 1824. The Carnot engine model was graphically expanded upon by Benoît Paul Émile Clapeyron in 1834 and mathematically elaborated upon by Rudolf Clausius in 1857 from which the concept of entropy emerged.\n\nEvery thermodynamic system exists in a particular state. A thermodynamic cycle occurs when a system is taken through a series of different states, and finally returned to its initial state. In the process of going through this cycle, the system may perform work on its surroundings, thereby acting as a heat engine.\n\nA heat engine acts by transferring energy from a warm region to a cool region of space and, in the process, converting some of that energy to mechanical work. The cycle may also be reversed. The system may be worked upon by an external force, and in the process, it can transfer thermal energy from a cooler system to a warmer one, thereby acting as a refrigerator or heat pump rather than a heat engine.\n\nIn the adjacent diagram, from Carnot's 1824 work, \"Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire\", there are \"two bodies \"A\" and \"B\", kept each at a constant temperature, that of \"A\" being higher than that of \"B\". These two bodies to which we can give, or from which we can remove the heat without causing their temperatures to vary, exercise the functions of two unlimited reservoirs of caloric. We will call the first the furnace and the second the refrigerator.” Carnot then explains how we can obtain motive power, i.e., “work”, by carrying a certain quantity of heat from body \"A\" to body \"B\".\nIt also acts as a cooler and hence can also act as a Refrigerator.\n\nThe previous image shows the original piston-and-cylinder diagram used by Carnot in discussing his ideal engines. The figure at right shows a block diagram of a generic heat engine, such as the Carnot engine. In the diagram, the “working body” (system), a term introduced by Clausius in 1850, can be any fluid or vapor body through which heat \"Q\" can be introduced or transmitted to produce work. Carnot had postulated that the fluid body could be any substance capable of expansion, such as vapor of water, vapor of alcohol, vapor of mercury, a permanent gas, or air, etc. Although, in these early years, engines came in a number of configurations, typically \"Q\" was supplied by a boiler, wherein water was boiled over a furnace; \"Q\" was typically supplied by a stream of cold flowing water in the form of a condenser located on a separate part of the engine. The output work \"W\" here is the movement of the piston as it is used to turn a crank-arm, which was then typically used to turn a pulley so to lift water out of flooded salt mines. Carnot defined work as “weight lifted through a height”.\n\nThe Carnot cycle when acting as a heat engine consists of the following steps:\n\n\nCarnot's theorem is a formal statement of this fact: \"No engine operating between two heat reservoirs can be more efficient than a Carnot engine operating between the same reservoirs.\"\n\nExplanation \nThis maximum efficiency formula_4 is defined as above:\n\nA corollary to Carnot's theorem states that: All reversible engines operating between the same heat reservoirs are equally efficient.\n\nIt is easily shown that the efficiency formula_9 is maximum when the entire cyclic process is a reversible process. This means the total entropy of the net system (the entropies of the hot furnace, the \"working fluid\" of the Heat engine, and the cold sink) remains constant when the \"working fluid\" completes one cycle and returns to its original state. (In the general case, the total entropy of this combined system would increase in a general irreversible process).\n\nSince the \"working fluid\" comes back to the same state after one cycle, and entropy of the system is a state function; the change in entropy of the \"working fluid\" system is 0. Thus, it implies that the total entropy change of the furnace and sink is zero, for the process to be reversible and the efficiency of the engine to be maximum. This derivation is carried out in the next section.\n\nThe Coefficient of Performance (COP) of the heat engine is the reciprocal of its efficiency.\n\nFor a real heat engine, the total thermodynamic process is generally irreversible. The working fluid is brought back to its initial state after one cycle, and thus the change of entropy of the fluid system is 0, but the sum of the entropy changes in the hot and cold reservoir in this one cyclical process is greater than 0.\n\nThe internal energy of the fluid is also a state variable, so its total change in one cycle is 0. So the total work done by the system formula_5, is equal to the heat put into the system formula_6 minus the heat taken out formula_12.\n\nFor real engines, sections 1 and 3 of the Carnot Cycle; in which heat is absorbed by the \"working fluid\" from the hot reservoir, and released by it to the cold reservoir, respectively; no longer remain ideally reversible, and there is a temperature differential between the temperature of the reservoir and the temperature of the fluid while heat exchange takes place.\n\nDuring heat transfer from the hot reservoir at formula_14 to the fluid, the fluid would have a slightly lower temperature than formula_14, and the process for the fluid may not necessarily remain isothermal. \nLet formula_16 be the total entropy change of the fluid in the process of intake of heat. \n\nwhere the temperature of the fluid formula_18 is always slightly lesser than formula_14, in this process.\n\nSo, one would get \n\nSimilarly, at the time of heat injection from the fluid to the cold reservoir one would have, for the magnitude of total entropy change formula_21 of the fluid in the process of expelling heat:\n\nwhere, during this process of transfer of heat to the cold reservoir, the temperature of the fluid formula_18 is always slightly greater than formula_24.\n\nWe have only considered the magnitude of the entropy change here. Since the total change of entropy of the fluid system for the cyclic process is 0, we must have\n\nThe previous three equations combine to give:\n\nEquations (2) and (7) combine to give \n\nHence,\n\nwhere formula_29 is the efficiency of the real engine, and formula_4 is the efficiency of the Carnot engine working between the same two reservoirs at the temperatures formula_14 and formula_24. For the Carnot engine, the entire process is 'reversible', and Equation (7) is an equality.\n\nHence, the efficiency of the real engine is always less than the ideal Carnot engine.\n\nEquation (7) signifies that the total entropy of the total system(the two reservoirs + fluid) increases for the real engine, because the entropy gain of the cold reservoir as formula_33 flows into it at the fixed temperature formula_24, is greater than the entropy loss of the hot reservoir as formula_35 leaves it at its fixed temperature formula_14. The inequality in Equation (7) is essentially the statement of the Clausius theorem.\n\nAccording to the second theorem, \"The efficiency of the Carnot engine is independent of the nature of the working substance\".\n\n"}

{"id": "6121", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6121", "title": "Central America", "text": "Central America\n\nCentral America () is the southernmost, isthmian portion of the North American continent, which connects with the South American continent on the southeast. Central America is bordered by Mexico to the north, Colombia to the southeast, the Caribbean Sea to the east, and the Pacific Ocean to the west. Central America consists of seven countries: Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama. The combined population of Central America is between 41,739,000 (2009 estimate) and 42,688,190 (2012 estimate).\n\nCentral America is a part of the Mesoamerican biodiversity hotspot, which extends from northern Guatemala through to central Panama. Due to the presence of several active geologic faults and the Central America Volcanic Arc, there is a great deal of seismic activity in the region. Volcanic eruptions and earthquakes occur frequently; these natural disasters have resulted in the loss of many lives and much property.\n\nIn the Pre-Columbian era, Central America was inhabited by the indigenous peoples of Mesoamerica to the north and west and the Isthmo-Colombian peoples to the south and east. Soon after Christopher Columbus's voyages to the Americas, the Spanish began to colonize the Americas. From 1609 until 1821, most of the territory within Central America—except for the lands that would become Belize and Panama—was governed by the Viceroyalty of New Spain from Mexico City as the Captaincy General of Guatemala. After New Spain achieved independence from Spain in 1821, some of its provinces were annexed to the First Mexican Empire, but soon seceded from Mexico to form the Federal Republic of Central America, which lasted from 1823 to 1838. The seven states finally became independent autonomous states: beginning with Nicaragua, Honduras, Costa Rica, and Guatemala (1838); followed by El Salvador (1841); then Panama (1903); and finally Belize (1981). Even today, though, people in Central America sometimes still refer to their nations as though they are provinces of a Central American state (e.g. it is still common to write \"C.A.\" after the country names, in formal and informal contexts).\n\n\"Central America\" may mean different things to various people, based upon different contexts:\n\n \n\nIn the Pre-Columbian era, the northern areas of Central America were inhabited by the indigenous peoples of Mesoamerica. Most notable among these were the Mayans, who had built numerous cities throughout the region, and the Aztecs, who had created a vast empire. The pre-Columbian cultures of eastern El Salvador, eastern Honduras, Caribbean Nicaragua, most of Costa Rica and Panama were predominantly speakers of the Chibchan languages at the time of European contact and are considered by some culturally different and grouped in the Isthmo-Colombian Area.\n\nFollowing Christopher Columbus's voyages to the Americas, the Spanish sent many expeditions to the region, and they began their conquest of Maya territory in 1523. Soon after the conquest of the Aztec Empire, Spanish conquistador Pedro de Alvarado commenced the conquest of northern Central America for the Spanish Empire. Beginning with his arrival in Soconusco in 1523, Alvarado's forces systematically conquered and subjugated most of the major Maya kingdoms, including the K'iche', Tz'utujil, Pipil, and the Kaqchikel. By 1528, the conquest of Guatemala was nearly complete, with only the Petén Basin remaining outside the Spanish sphere of influence. The last independent Maya kingdoms – the Kowoj and the Itza people – were finally defeated in 1697, as part of the Spanish conquest of Petén.\n\nIn 1538, Spain established the Real Audiencia of Panama, which had jurisdiction over all land from the Strait of Magellan to the Gulf of Fonseca. This entity was dissolved in 1543, and most of the territory within Central America then fell under the jurisdiction of the \"Audiencia Real de Guatemala\". This area included the current territories of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and the Mexican state of Chiapas, but excluded the lands that would become Belize and Panama. The president of the Audiencia, which had its seat in Antigua Guatemala, was the governor of the entire area. In 1609 the area became a captaincy general and the governor was also granted the title of captain general. The Captaincy General of Guatemala encompassed most of Central America, with the exception of present-day Belize and Panama.\n\nThe Captaincy General of Guatemala lasted for more than two centuries, but began to fray after a rebellion in 1811 which began in the intendancy of San Salvador. The Captaincy General formally ended on 15 September 1821, with the signing of the Act of Independence of Central America. Mexican independence was achieved at virtually the same time with the signing of the Treaty of Córdoba and the Declaration of Independence of the Mexican Empire, and the entire region was finally independent from Spanish authority by 28 September 1821.\n\nFrom its independence from Spain in 1821 until 1823, the former Captaincy General remained intact as part of the short-lived First Mexican Empire. When the Emperor of Mexico abdicated on 19 March 1823, Central America again became independent. On 1 July 1823, the Congress of Central America peacefully seceded from Mexico and declared absolute independence from all foreign nations, and the region formed the Federal Republic of Central America.\n\nThe Federal Republic of Central America was a representative democracy with its capital at Guatemala City. This union consisted of the provinces of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Los Altos, Mosquito Coast, and Nicaragua. The lowlands of southwest Chiapas, including Soconusco, initially belonged to the Republic until 1824, when Mexico annexed most of Chiapas and began its claims to Soconusco. The Republic lasted from 1823 to 1838, when it disintegrated as a result of civil wars.\n\nThe territory that now makes up Belize was heavily contested in a dispute that continued for decades after Guatemala achieved independence (see History of Belize (1506–1862). Spain, and later Guatemala, considered this land a Guatemalan department. In 1862, Britain formally declared it a British colony and named it British Honduras. It became independent as Belize in 1981.\n\nPanama, situated in the southernmost part of Central America on the Isthmus of Panama, has for most of its history been culturally linked to South America. Panama was part of the Province of Tierra Firme from 1510 until 1538 when it came under the jurisdiction of the newly formed \"Audiencia Real de Panama\". Beginning in 1543, Panama was administered as part of the Viceroyalty of Peru, along with all other Spanish possessions in South America. Panama remained as part of the Viceroyalty of Peru until 1739, when it was transferred to the Viceroyalty of New Granada, the capital of which was located at Santa Fé de Bogotá. Panama remained as part of the Viceroyalty of New Granada until the disestablishment of that viceroyalty in 1819. A series of military and political struggles took place from that time until 1822, the result of which produced the republic of Gran Colombia. After the dissolution of Gran Colombia in 1830, Panama became part of a successor state, the Republic of New Granada. From 1855 until 1886, Panama existed as Panama State, first within the Republic of New Granada, then within the Granadine Confederation, and finally within the United States of Colombia. The United States of Colombia was replaced by the Republic of Colombia in 1886. As part of the Republic of Colombia, Panama State was abolished and it became the Isthmus Department. Despite the many political reorganizations, Colombia was still deeply plagued by conflict, which eventually led to the secession of Panama on 3 November 1903. Only after that time did some begin to regard Panama as a North or Central American entity.\n\nBy the 1930s the United Fruit Company owned 3.5 million acres of land in Central America and the Caribbean and was the single largest land owner in Guatemala. Such holdings gave it great power over the governments of small countries. That was one of the factors that led to the coining of the phrase Banana Republic. \n\nAfter more than two hundred years of social unrest, violent conflict and revolution, Central America today remains in a period of political transformation. Poverty, social injustice and violence are still widespread. Nicaragua is the second poorest country in the western hemisphere (only Haiti is poorer).\n\nCentral America is the tapering isthmus of southern North America, with unique and varied geographic features. The Pacific Ocean lies to the southwest, the Caribbean Sea lies to the northeast, and the Gulf of Mexico lies to the north. Some physiographists define the Isthmus of Tehuantepec as the northern geographic border of Central America, while others use the northwestern borders of Belize and Guatemala. From there, the Central American land mass extends southeastward to the Isthmus of Panama, where it connects to the Pacific Lowlands in northwestern South America.\n\nOf the many mountain ranges within Central America, the longest are the Sierra Madre de Chiapas, the Cordillera Isabelia and the Cordillera de Talamanca. At , Volcán Tajumulco is the highest peak in Central America. Other high points of Central America are as listed in the table below:\nHigh points in Central America\n\nBetween the mountain ranges lie fertile valleys that are suitable for the raising of livestock and for the production of coffee, tobacco, beans and other crops. Most of the population of Honduras, Costa Rica and Guatemala lives in valleys.\n\nTrade winds have a significant effect upon the climate of Central America. Temperatures in Central America are highest just prior to the summer wet season, and are lowest during the winter dry season, when trade winds contribute to a cooler climate. The highest temperatures occur in April, due to higher levels of sunlight, lower cloud cover and a decrease in trade winds.\n\nCentral America is part of the Mesoamerican biodiversity hotspot, boasting 7% of the world's biodiversity. The Pacific Flyway is a major north-south flyway for migratory birds in the Americas, extending from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego. Due to the funnel-like shape of its land mass, migratory birds can be seen in very high concentrations in Central America, especially in the spring and autumn. As a bridge between North America and South America, Central America has many species from the Nearctic and the Neotropic ecozones. However the southern countries (Costa Rica and Panama) of the region have more biodiversity than the northern countries (Guatemala and Belize), meanwhile the central countries (Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador) have the least biodiversity. The table below shows recent statistics:\nBiodiversity in Central America (number of different species of terrestrial vertebrate animals and vascular plants)\n\nOver 300 species of the region's flora and fauna are threatened, 107 of which are classified as critically endangered. The underlying problems are deforestation, which is estimated by FAO at 1.2% per year in Central America and Mexico combined, fragmentation of rainforests and the fact that 80% of the vegetation in Central America has already been converted to agriculture.\n\nEfforts to protect fauna and flora in the region are made by creating ecoregions and nature reserves. 36% of Belize's land territory falls under some form of official protected status, giving Belize one of the most extensive systems of terrestrial protected areas in the Americas. In addition, 13% of Belize's marine territory are also protected. A large coral reef extends from Mexico to Honduras: the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System. The Belize Barrier Reef is part of this. The Belize Barrier Reef is home to a large diversity of plants and animals, and is one of the most diverse ecosystems of the world. It is home to 70 hard coral species, 36 soft coral species, 500 species of fish and hundreds of invertebrate species.\nSo far only about 10% of the species in the Belize barrier reef have been discovered.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2010, of forest were lost in the region. In 2010 Belize had 63% of remaining forest cover, Costa Rica 46%, Panama 45%, Honduras 41%, Guatemala 37%, Nicaragua 29%, and El Salvador 21%. Most of the loss occurred in the moist forest biome, with . Woody vegetation loss was partially set off by a gain in the coniferous forest biome with , and a gain in the dry forest biome at . Mangroves and deserts contributed only 1% to the loss in forest vegetation. The bulk of the deforestation was located at the Caribbean slopes of Nicaragua with a loss of of forest in the period from 2001 to 2010. The most significant regrowth of of forest was seen in the coniferous woody vegetation of Honduras.\n\nThe Central American pine-oak forests ecoregion, in the tropical and subtropical coniferous forests biome, is found in Central America and southern Mexico. The Central American pine-oak forests occupy an area of , extending along the mountainous spine of Central America, extending from the Sierra Madre de Chiapas in Mexico's Chiapas state through the highlands of Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras to central Nicaragua. The pine-oak forests lie between elevation, and are surrounded at lower elevations by tropical moist forests and tropical dry forests. Higher elevations above are usually covered with Central American montane forests. The Central American pine-oak forests are composed of many species characteristic of temperate North America including oak, pine, fir, and cypress.\n\nLaurel forest is the most common type of Central American temperate evergreen cloud forest, found in almost all Central American countries, normally more than above sea level. Tree species include evergreen oaks, members of the laurel family, and species of \"Weinmannia\", \"Drimys\", and \"Magnolia\". The cloud forest of Sierra de las Minas, Guatemala, is the largest in Central America. In some areas of southeastern Honduras there are cloud forests, the largest located near the border with Nicaragua. In Nicaragua, cloud forests are situated near the border with Honduras, but many were cleared to grow coffee. There are still some temperate evergreen hills in the north. The only cloud forest in the Pacific coastal zone of Central America is on the Mombacho volcano in Nicaragua. In Costa Rica, there are laurel forests in the Cordillera de Tilarán and Volcán Arenal, called Monteverde, also in the Cordillera de Talamanca.\n\nThe Central American montane forests are an ecoregion of the tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests biome, as defined by the World Wildlife Fund. These forests are of the moist deciduous and the semi-evergreen seasonal subtype of tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests and receive high overall rainfall with a warm summer wet season and a cooler winter dry season. Central American montane forests consist of forest patches located at altitudes ranging from , on the summits and slopes of the highest mountains in Central America ranging from Southern Mexico, through Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras, to northern Nicaragua. The entire ecoregion covers an area of and has a temperate climate with relatively high precipitation levels.\n\nEcoregions are not only established to protect the forests themselves but also because they are habitats for an incomparably rich and often endemic fauna. Almost half of the bird population of the Talamancan montane forests in Costa Rica and Panama are endemic to this region. Several birds are listed as threatened, most notably the resplendent quetzal (Pharomacrus mocinno), three-wattled bellbird (Procnias tricarunculata), bare-necked umbrellabird (Cephalopterus glabricollis), and black guan (Chamaepetes unicolor). Many of the amphibians are endemic and depend on the existence of forest. The golden toad that once inhabited a small region in the Monteverde Reserve, which is part of the Talamancan montane forests, has not been seen alive since 1989 and is listed as extinct by IUCN. The exact causes for its extincition are unknown. Global warming may have played a role, because the development of fog that is typical for this area may have been compromised. Seven small mammals are endemic to the Costa Rica-Chiriqui highlands within the Talamancan montane forest region. Jaguars, cougars, spider monkeys, as well as tapirs, and anteaters live in the woods of Central America. The Central American red brocket is a brocket deer found in Central America's tropical forest.\n\nCentral America is geologically very active, with volcanic eruptions and earthquakes occurring frequently, and tsunamis occurring occasionally. Many thousands of people have died as a result of these natural disasters.\n\nMost of Central America rests atop the Caribbean Plate. This tectonic plate converges with the Cocos, Nazca, and North American plates to form the Middle America Trench, a major subduction zone. The Middle America Trench is situated some off the Pacific coast of Central America and runs roughly parallel to it. Many large earthquakes have occurred as a result of seismic activity at the Middle America Trench. For example, subduction of the Cocos Plate beneath the North American Plate at the Middle America Trench is believed to have caused the 1985 Mexico City earthquake that killed as many as 40,000 people. Seismic activity at the Middle America Trench is also responsible for earthquakes in 1902, 1942, 1956, 1982, 1992, 2001, 2007, 2012, 2014, and many other earthquakes throughout Central America.\n\nThe Middle America Trench is not the only source of seismic activity in Central America. The Motagua Fault is an onshore continuation of the Cayman Trough which forms part of the tectonic boundary between the North American Plate and the Caribbean Plate. This transform fault cuts right across Guatemala and then continues offshore until it merges with the Middle America Trench along the Pacific coast of Mexico, near Acapulco. Seismic activity at the Motagua Fault has been responsible for earthquakes in 1717, 1773, 1902, 1976, 1980, and 2009.\n\nAnother onshore continuation of the Cayman Trough is the Chixoy-Polochic Fault, which runs parallel to, and roughly to the north, of the Motagua Fault. Though less active than the Motagua Fault, seismic activity at the Chixoy-Polochic Fault is still thought to be capable of producing very large earthquakes, such as the 1816 earthquake of Guatemala.\n\nManagua, the capital of Nicaragua, was devastated by earthquakes in 1931 and 1972.\n\nVolcanic eruptions are also common in Central America. In 1968 the Arenal Volcano, in Costa Rica, erupted killing 87 people as the 3 villages of Tabacon, Pueblo Nuevo and San Luis were buried under pyroclastic flows and debris. Fertile soils from weathered volcanic lava have made it possible to sustain dense populations in the agriculturally productive highland areas.\n\nThe population of Central America is estimated at 42,688,190 as of 2012. With an area of , it has a population density of .\n\nThe official language majority in all Central American countries is Spanish, except in Belize, where the official language is English. Mayan languages constitute a language family consisting of about 26 related languages. Guatemala formally recognized 21 of these in 1996. Xinca and Garifuna are also present in Central America.\n\nThis region of the continent is very rich in terms of ethnic groups. The majority of the population is mestizo, with sizable Mayan and White populations present, including Xinca and Garifuna minorities. The immigration of Arabs, Jews, Chinese, Europeans and others brought additional groups to the area.\n\nThe predominant religion in Central America is Christianity (95.6%). Beginning with the Spanish colonization of Central America in the 16th century, Roman Catholicism became the most popular religion in the region until the first half of the 20th century. Since the 1960s, there has been an increase in other Christian groups, particularly Protestantism, as well as other religious organizations, and individuals identifying themselves as having no religion.\n\n\nCentral America is currently undergoing a process of political, economic and cultural transformation that started in 1907 with the creation of the Central American Court of Justice.\n\nIn 1951 the integration process continued with the signature of the San Salvador Treaty, which created the ODECA, the Organization of Central American States. However, the unity of the ODECA was limited by conflicts between several member states.\n\nIn 1991, the integration agenda was further advanced by the creation of the Central American Integration System (\"Sistema para la Integración Centroamericana\", or SICA). SICA provides a clear legal basis to avoid disputes between the member states. SICA membership includes the 7 nations of Central America plus the Dominican Republic, a state that is traditionally considered part of the Caribbean.\n\nOn 6 December 2008 SICA announced an agreement to pursue a common currency and common passport for the member nations. No timeline for implementation was discussed.\n\nCentral America already has several supranational institutions such as the Central American Parliament, the Central American Bank for Economic Integration and the Central American Common Market.\n\nOn 22 July 2011 President Mauricio Funes of El Salvador became the first president \"pro tempore\" to SICA. El Salvador also became the headquarters of SICA with the inauguration of a new building.\n\nUntil recently, all Central American countries have maintained diplomatic relations with Taiwan instead of China. President Óscar Arias of Costa Rica, however, established diplomatic relations with China in 2007, severing formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan. After breaking off relations with the Republic of China in 2017, Panama established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China.\n\nThe Central American Parliament (also known as PARLACEN) is a political and parliamentary body of SICA. The parliament's beginnings started at around 1980, and its primary goal was to solve wars in Nicaragua, Guatemala, and El Salvador. Although the group was disbanded in 1986, ideas of unity of Central Americans still remained, so a treaty was signed in 1987 to create the Central American Parliament and other political bodies. Its original members were Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Honduras. The parliament is the political organ of Central America, and is part of SICA. New members have since then joined including Panama and the Dominican Republic.\n\nSigned in 2004, the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) is an agreement between the United States, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and the Dominican Republic. The treaty is aimed at promoting free trade among its members.\n\nGuatemala has the largest economy in the region. Its main exports are coffee, sugar, bananas, petroleum, clothing, and cardamom. Of its 10.29 billion dollar annual exports, 40.2% go to the United States, 11.1% to neighboring El Salvador, 8% to Honduras, 5.5% to Mexico, 4.7% to Nicaragua, and 4.3% to Costa Rica.\n\nEconomic growth in Central America is projected to slow slightly in 2014–15, as country-specific domestic factors offset the positive effects from stronger economic activity in the United States.\n\nTourism in Belize has grown considerably in more recent times, and it is now the second largest industry in the nation. Belizean Prime Minister Dean Barrow has stated his intention to use tourism to combat poverty throughout the country. The growth in tourism has positively affected the agricultural, commercial, and finance industries, as well as the construction industry. The results for Belize's tourism-driven economy have been significant, with the nation welcoming almost one million tourists in a calendar year for the first time in its history in 2012. Belize is also the only country in Central America with English as its official language, making this country a comfortable destination for English-speaking tourists.\n\nCosta Rica is the most visited nation in Central America. Tourism in Costa Rica is one of the fastest growing economic sectors of the country, having become the largest source of foreign revenue by 1995. Since 1999, tourism has earned more foreign exchange than bananas, pineapples and coffee exports combined. The tourism boom began in 1987, with the number of visitors up from 329,000 in 1988, through 1.03 million in 1999, to a historical record of 2.43 million foreign visitors and $1.92-billion in revenue in 2013. In 2012 tourism contributed with 12.5% of the country's GDP and it was responsible for 11.7% of direct and indirect employment.\n\nTourism in Nicaragua has grown considerably recently, and it is now the second largest industry in the nation. Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega has stated his intention to use tourism to combat poverty throughout the country. The growth in tourism has positively affected the agricultural, commercial, and finance industries, as well as the construction industry. The results for Nicaragua's tourism-driven economy have been significant, with the nation welcoming one million tourists in a calendar year for the first time in its history in 2010.\n\nThe Inter-American Highway is the Central American section of the Pan-American Highway, and spans between Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, and Panama City, Panama. Because of the break in the highway known as the Darién Gap, it is not possible to cross between Central America and South America in an automobile.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6122", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6122", "title": "Continuous function", "text": "Continuous function\n\nIn mathematics, a continuous function is a function for which sufficiently small changes in the input result in arbitrarily small changes in the output. Otherwise, a function is said to be a \"discontinuous\" function. A continuous function with a continuous inverse function is called a homeomorphism.\n\nContinuity of functions is one of the core concepts of topology, which is treated in full generality below. The introductory portion of this article focuses on the special case where the inputs and outputs of functions are real numbers. In addition, this article discusses the definition for the more general case of functions between two metric spaces. In order theory, especially in domain theory, one considers a notion of continuity known as Scott continuity. Other forms of continuity do exist but they are not discussed in this article.\n\nAs an example, consider the function \"h\"(\"t\"), which describes the height of a growing flower at time \"t\". This function is continuous. By contrast, if \"M\"(\"t\") denotes the amount of money in a bank account at time \"t\", then the function jumps at each point in time when money is deposited or withdrawn, so the function \"M\"(\"t\") is discontinuous.\n\nA form of the epsilon–delta definition of continuity was first given by Bernard Bolzano in 1817. Augustin-Louis Cauchy defined continuity of formula_1 as follows: an infinitely small increment formula_2 of the independent variable \"x\" always produces an infinitely small change formula_3 of the dependent variable \"y\" (see e.g., \"Cours d'Analyse\", p. 34). Cauchy defined infinitely small quantities in terms of variable quantities, and his definition of continuity closely parallels the infinitesimal definition used today (see microcontinuity). The formal definition and the distinction between pointwise continuity and uniform continuity were first given by Bolzano in the 1830s but the work wasn't published until the 1930s. Like Bolzano, Karl Weierstrass denied continuity of a function at a point \"c\" unless it was defined at and on both sides of \"c\", but Édouard Goursat allowed the function to be defined only at and on one side of \"c\", and Camille Jordan allowed it even if the function was defined only at \"c\". All three of those nonequivalent definitions of pointwise continuity are still in use. Eduard Heine provided the first published definition of uniform continuity in 1872, but based these ideas on lectures given by Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet in 1854.\n\nA function from the set of real numbers to the real numbers can be represented by a graph in the Cartesian plane; such a function is continuous if, roughly speaking, the graph is a single unbroken curve with no \"holes\" or \"jumps\". This is not a rigorous definition of continuity since the function formula_4 is continuous on its whole domain of formula_5 (but it is not continuous over the domain formula_6 because it is discontinuous at formula_7.)\n\nA function is \"continuous at a point\" if it does not have a hole or jump. A \"hole\" or \"jump\" in the graph of a function occurs if the value of the function at a point \"c\" differs from its limiting value along points that are nearby. Such a point is called a \"discontinuity\". A function is then \"continuous\" if it has no holes or jumps: that is, if it is continuous at every point of its domain. Otherwise, a function is \"discontinuous\", at the points where the value of the function differs from its limiting value (if any).\n\nThere are several ways to make this definition mathematically rigorous. These definitions are equivalent to one another, so the most convenient definition can be used to determine whether a given function is continuous or not. In the definitions below,\nis a function defined on a subset \"I\" of the set R of real numbers. This subset \"I\" is referred to as the domain of \"f\". Some possible choices include \"I\"=R, the whole set of real numbers, an open interval\nor a closed interval\nHere, \"a\" and \"b\" are real numbers.\n\nThe function \"f\" is \"continuous at some point\" \"c\" of its domain if the limit of \"f\"(\"x\") as \"x\" approaches \"c\" through the domain of \"f\" exists and is equal to \"f\"(\"c\"). In mathematical notation, this is written as\nIn detail this means three conditions: first, \"f\" has to be defined at \"c\". Second, the limit on the left hand side of that equation has to exist. Third, the value of this limit must equal \"f\"(\"c\").\n\nA neighborhood of a point \"c\" is a set that contains all points of the domain within some fixed distance of \"c\". Intuitively, a function is continuous at a point \"c\" if the range of the restriction of \"f\" to a neighborhood of \"c\" shrinks to a single point \"f\"(\"c\") as the width of the neighborhood around \"c\" shrinks to zero. More precisely, a function \"f\" is continuous at a point \"c\" of its domain if, for any neighborhood formula_12 there is a neighborhood formula_13 such that formula_14 whenever formula_15.\n\nThis definition does only require that the domain and the codomain are topological spaces and is thus the most general definition. From it follows, that the function \"f\" is automatically continuous at every isolated point of its domain. As a specific example, every real valued function on the set of integers is continuous.\n\nOne can instead require that for any sequence formula_16 of points in the domain which converges to \"c\", the corresponding sequence formula_17 converges to \"f\"(\"c\"). In mathematical notation, formula_18\n\nExplicitly including the definition of the limit of a function, we obtain a self-contained definition:\nGiven a function \"f\" : \"I\" → \"R\" as above and an element \"x\" of the domain \"I\", \"f\" is said to be continuous at the point \"x\" when the following holds: For any number \"ε\" > 0, however small, there exists some number \"δ\" > 0 such that for all \"x\" in the domain of \"f\" with \"x\" − \"δ\" < \"x\" < \"x\" + \"δ\", the value of \"f\"(\"x\") satisfies\n\nAlternatively written, continuity of \"f\" : \"I\" → \"R\" at \"x\" ∈ \"I\" means that for every \"ε\" > 0 there exists a \"δ\" > 0 such that for all \"x\" ∈ \"I\" :\n\nMore intuitively, we can say that if we want to get all the \"f\"(\"x\") values to stay in some small neighborhood around \"f\"(\"x\"), we simply need to choose a small enough neighborhood for the \"x\" values around \"x\". If we can do that no matter how small the \"f\"(\"x\") neighborhood is, then \"f\" is continuous at \"x\".\n\nIn modern terms, this is generalized by the definition of continuity of a function with respect to a basis for the topology, here the metric topology.\n\nWeierstrass had required that the interval \"x\" − \"δ\" < \"x\" < \"x\" + \"δ\" be entirely within the domain \"I\", but Jordan removed that restriction.\n\nIn proofs and numerical analysis we often need to know how fast limits are converging, or in other words, control of the remainder. We can formalise this to a definition of continuity. \nA function formula_21 is called a control function if\n\nA function \"f\" : \"I\" → \"R\" is \"C\"-continuous at \"x\" if \n\nA function is continuous in \"x\" if it is \"C\"-continuous for some control function \"C\". \n\nThis approach leads naturally to refining the notion of continuity by restricting the set of admissible control functions. For a given set of control functions formula_25 a function is formula_25 continuous if it is \"C\" continuous for some formula_27. For example the Lipschitz and Hölder continuous functions of exponent α below are defined by the set of control functions \nrespectively \n\nContinuity can also be defined in terms of oscillation: a function \"f\" is continuous at a point \"x\" if and only if its oscillation at that point is zero; in symbols, formula_31 A benefit of this definition is that it \"quantifies\" discontinuity: the oscillation gives how \"much\" the function is discontinuous at a point.\n\nThis definition is useful in descriptive set theory to study the set of discontinuities and continuous points – the continuous points are the intersection of the sets where the oscillation is less than \"ε\" (hence a G set) – and gives a very quick proof of one direction of the Lebesgue integrability condition.\n\nThe oscillation is equivalent to the \"ε\"-\"δ\" definition by a simple re-arrangement, and by using a limit (lim sup, lim inf) to define oscillation: if (at a given point) for a given \"ε\" there is no \"δ\" that satisfies the \"ε\"-\"δ\" definition, then the oscillation is at least \"ε\", and conversely if for every \"ε\" there is a desired \"δ,\" the oscillation is 0. The oscillation definition can be naturally generalized to maps from a topological space to a metric space.\n\nCauchy defined continuity of a function in the following intuitive terms: an infinitesimal change in the independent variable corresponds to an infinitesimal change of the dependent variable (see \"Cours d'analyse\", page 34). Non-standard analysis is a way of making this mathematically rigorous. The real line is augmented by the addition of infinite and infinitesimal numbers to form the hyperreal numbers. In nonstandard analysis, continuity can be defined as follows.\n\n(see microcontinuity). In other words, an infinitesimal increment of the independent variable always produces to an infinitesimal change of the dependent variable, giving a modern expression to Augustin-Louis Cauchy's definition of continuity.\n\nAll polynomial functions, such as\n\n(pictured), are continuous. This is a consequence of the fact that, given two continuous functions\ndefined on the same domain \"I\", then the sum \"f\" + \"g\" and the product \"fg\" of the two functions are continuous (on the same domain \"I\"). Moreover, the function\nis continuous. (The points where \"g\"(\"x\") is zero are discarded, as they are not in the domain of \"f\"/\"g\".) For example, the function (pictured)\n\nis defined for all real numbers and is continuous at every such point. Thus it is a continuous function. The question of continuity at does not arise, since is not in the domain of \"f\". There is no continuous function \"F\": R → R that agrees with \"f\"(\"x\") for all . The sinc function \"g\"(\"x\") = (sin \"x\")/\"x\", defined for all \"x\"≠0 is continuous at these points. Thus it is a continuous function, too. However, unlike the one of the previous example, this one \"can\" be extended to a continuous function on all real numbers, namely\nsince the limit of \"g\"(\"x\"), when \"x\" approaches 0, is 1. Therefore, the point \"x\"=0 is called a removable singularity of \"g\".\n\nGiven two continuous functions\nthe composition\nis continuous.\n\nAn example of a discontinuous function is the Heaviside step function formula_38, defined by\n\nPick for instance formula_40. There is no around formula_41 that will force all the formula_42 values to be within formula_43 of formula_44. Intuitively we can think of this type of discontinuity as a sudden jump in function values.\n\nSimilarly, the signum or sign function\nis discontinuous at formula_41 but continuous everywhere else. Yet another example: the function\nis continuous everywhere apart from formula_41.\nThomae's function,\nis continuous at all irrational numbers and discontinuous at all rational numbers. In a similar vein, Dirichlet's function\nis nowhere continuous.\n\nThe intermediate value theorem is an existence theorem, based on the real number property of completeness, and states:\n\nFor example, if a child grows from 1 m to 1.5 m between the ages of two and six years, then, at some time between two and six years of age, the child's height must have been 1.25 m.\n\nAs a consequence, if \"f\" is continuous on [\"a\", \"b\"] and \"f\"(\"a\") and \"f\"(\"b\") differ in sign, then, at some point \"c\" in [\"a\", \"b\"], \"f\"(\"c\") must equal zero.\n\nThe extreme value theorem states that if a function \"f\" is defined on a closed interval [\"a\",\"b\"] (or any closed and bounded set) and is continuous there, then the function attains its maximum, i.e. there exists \"c\" ∈ [\"a\",\"b\"] with \"f\"(\"c\") ≥ \"f\"(\"x\") for all \"x\" ∈ [\"a\",\"b\"]. The same is true of the minimum of \"f\". These statements are not, in general, true if the function is defined on an open interval (\"a\",\"b\") (or any set that is not both closed and bounded), as, for example, the continuous function \"f\"(\"x\") = 1/\"x\", defined on the open interval (0,1), does not attain a maximum, being unbounded above.\n\nEvery differentiable function\nis continuous, as can be shown. The converse does not hold: for example, the absolute value function\nis everywhere continuous. However, it is not differentiable at \"x\" = 0 (but is so everywhere else). Weierstrass's function is also everywhere continuous but nowhere differentiable.\n\nThe derivative \"f′\"(\"x\") of a differentiable function \"f\"(\"x\") need not be continuous. If \"f′\"(\"x\") is continuous, \"f\"(\"x\") is said to be continuously differentiable. The set of such functions is denoted \"C\"(). More generally, the set of functions\n(from an open interval (or open subset of R) Ω to the reals) such that \"f\" is \"n\" times differentiable and such that the \"n\"-th derivative of \"f\" is continuous is denoted \"C\"(Ω). See differentiability class. In the field of computer graphics, these three levels are sometimes called \"G\" (continuity of position), \"G\" (continuity of tangency), and \"G\" (continuity of curvature).\n\nEvery continuous function\nis integrable (for example in the sense of the Riemann integral). The converse does not hold, as the (integrable, but discontinuous) sign function shows.\n\nGiven a sequence\nof functions such that the limit\nexists for all \"x\" in \"I\", the resulting function \"f\"(\"x\") is referred to as the pointwise limit of the sequence of functions (\"f\"). The pointwise limit function need not be continuous, even if all functions \"f\" are continuous, as the animation at the right shows. However, \"f\" is continuous when the sequence converges uniformly, by the uniform convergence theorem. This theorem can be used to show that the exponential functions, logarithms, square root function, trigonometric functions are continuous.\n\nDiscontinuous functions may be discontinuous in a restricted way, giving rise to the concept of directional continuity (or right and left continuous functions) and semi-continuity. Roughly speaking, a function is \"right-continuous\" if no jump occurs when the limit point is approached from the right. Formally, \"f\" is said to be right-continuous at the point \"c\" if the following holds: For any number \"ε\" > 0 however small, there exists some number \"δ\" > 0 such that for all \"x\" in the domain with , the value of \"f\"(\"x\") will satisfy\n\nThis is the same condition as for continuous functions, except that it is required to hold for \"x\" strictly larger than \"c\" only. Requiring it instead for all \"x\" with yields the notion of \"left-continuous\" functions. A function is continuous if and only if it is both right-continuous and left-continuous.\n\nA function \"f\" is \"lower semi-continuous\" if, roughly, any jumps that might occur only go down, but not up. That is, for any \"ε\" > 0, there exists some number \"δ\" > 0 such that for all \"x\" in the domain with , the value of \"f\"(\"x\") satisfies\nThe reverse condition is \"upper semi-continuity\".\n\nThe concept of continuous real-valued functions can be generalized to functions between metric spaces. A metric space is a set \"X\" equipped with a function (called metric) \"d\", that can be thought of as a measurement of the distance of any two elements in \"X\". Formally, the metric is a function\nthat satisfies a number of requirements, notably the triangle inequality. Given two metric spaces (\"X\", d) and (\"Y\", d) and a function\nthen \"f\" is continuous at the point \"c\" in \"X\" (with respect to the given metrics) if for any positive real number ε, there exists a positive real number δ such that all \"x\" in \"X\" satisfying d(\"x\", \"c\") < δ will also satisfy d(\"f\"(\"x\"), \"f\"(\"c\")) < ε. As in the case of real functions above, this is equivalent to the condition that for every sequence (\"x\") in \"X\" with limit lim \"x\" = \"c\", we have lim \"f\"(\"x\") = \"f\"(\"c\"). The latter condition can be weakened as follows: \"f\" is continuous at the point \"c\" if and only if for every convergent sequence (\"x\") in \"X\" with limit \"c\", the sequence (\"f\"(\"x\")) is a Cauchy sequence, and \"c\" is in the domain of \"f\".\n\nThe set of points at which a function between metric spaces is continuous is a G set – this follows from the ε-δ definition of continuity.\n\nThis notion of continuity is applied, for example, in functional analysis. A key statement in this area says that a linear operator\nbetween normed vector spaces \"V\" and \"W\" (which are vector spaces equipped with a compatible norm, denoted ||\"x\"||)\nis continuous if and only if it is bounded, that is, there is a constant \"K\" such that\nfor all \"x\" in \"V\".\n\nThe concept of continuity for functions between metric spaces can be strengthened in various ways by limiting the way δ depends on ε and \"c\" in the definition above. Intuitively, a function \"f\" as above is uniformly continuous if the δ does\nnot depend on the point \"c\". More precisely, it is required that for every real number \"ε\" > 0 there exists \"δ\" > 0 such that for every \"c\", \"b\" ∈ \"X\" with \"d\"(\"b\", \"c\") < \"δ\", we have that \"d\"(\"f\"(\"b\"), \"f\"(\"c\")) < \"ε\". Thus, any uniformly continuous function is continuous. The converse does not hold in general, but holds when the domain space \"X\" is compact. Uniformly continuous maps can be defined in the more general situation of uniform spaces.\n\nA function is Hölder continuous with exponent α (a real number) if there is a constant \"K\" such that for all \"b\" and \"c\" in \"X\", the inequality\nholds. Any Hölder continuous function is uniformly continuous. The particular case is referred to as Lipschitz continuity. That is, a function is Lipschitz continuous if there is a constant \"K\" such that the inequality\nholds for any \"b\", \"c\" in \"X\". The Lipschitz condition occurs, for example, in the Picard–Lindelöf theorem concerning the solutions of ordinary differential equations.\n\nAnother, more abstract, notion of continuity is continuity of functions between topological spaces in which there generally is no formal notion of distance, as there is in the case of metric spaces. A topological space is a set \"X\" together with a topology on \"X\", which is a set of subsets of \"X\" satisfying a few requirements with respect to their unions and intersections that generalize the properties of the open balls in metric spaces while still allowing to talk about the neighbourhoods of a given point. The elements of a topology are called open subsets of \"X\" (with respect to the topology).\n\nA function\nbetween two topological spaces \"X\" and \"Y\" is continuous if for every open set \"V\" ⊆ \"Y\", the inverse image\nis an open subset of \"X\". That is, \"f\" is a function between the sets \"X\" and \"Y\" (not on the elements of the topology \"T\"), but the continuity of \"f\" depends on the topologies used on \"X\" and \"Y\".\n\nThis is equivalent to the condition that the preimages of the closed sets (which are the complements of the open subsets) in \"Y\" are closed in \"X\".\n\nAn extreme example: if a set \"X\" is given the discrete topology (in which every subset is open), all functions\nto any topological space \"T\" are continuous. On the other hand, if \"X\" is equipped with the indiscrete topology (in which the only open subsets are the empty set and \"X\") and the space \"T\" set is at least T, then the only continuous functions are the constant functions. Conversely, any function whose range is indiscrete is continuous.\n\nSeveral equivalent definitions for a topological structure exist and thus there are several equivalent ways to define a continuous function.\n\nContinuity for functions between topological spaces formula_68 and formula_69 at a point may be defined using the notion of neighborhoods: \nThis definition can be shown to be equivalent to the same statement, with open neighborhoods instead of neighborhoods.\n\nIf \"X\" and \"Y\" are metric spaces, it is equivalent to consider the neighborhood system of open balls centered at \"x\" and \"f\"(\"x\") instead of all neighborhoods. This gives back the above δ-ε definition of continuity in the context of metric spaces. In general topological spaces, there is no notion of nearness or distance. If however the target space is a Hausdorff space, it is still true that \"f\" is continuous at \"a\" if and only if the limit of \"f\" as \"x\" approaches \"a\" is \"f\"(\"a\"). At an isolated point, every function is continuous.\n\nIn several contexts, the topology of a space is conveniently specified in terms of limit points. In many instances, this is accomplished by specifying when a point is the limit of a sequence, but for some spaces that are too large in some sense, one specifies also when a point is the limit of more general sets of points indexed by a directed set, known as nets. A function is (Heine-)continuous only if it takes limits of sequences to limits of sequences. In the former case, preservation of limits is also sufficient; in the latter, a function may preserve all limits of sequences yet still fail to be continuous, and preservation of nets is a necessary and sufficient condition.\n\nIn detail, a function \"f\": \"X\" → \"Y\" is sequentially continuous if whenever a sequence (\"x\") in \"X\" converges to a limit \"x\", the sequence (\"f\"(\"x\")) converges to \"f\"(\"x\"). Thus sequentially continuous functions \"preserve sequential limits\". Every continuous function is sequentially continuous. If \"X\" is a first-countable space and countable choice holds, then the converse also holds: any function preserving sequential limits is continuous. In particular, if \"X\" is a metric space, sequential continuity and continuity are equivalent. For non first-countable spaces, sequential continuity might be strictly weaker than continuity. (The spaces for which the two properties are equivalent are called sequential spaces.) This motivates the consideration of nets instead of sequences in general topological spaces. Continuous functions preserve limits of nets, and in fact this property characterizes continuous functions.\n\nInstead of specifying the open subsets of a topological space, the topology can also be determined by a closure operator (denoted cl) which assigns to any subset \"A\" ⊆ \"X\" its closure, or an interior operator (denoted int), which assigns to any subset \"A\" of \"X\" its interior. In these terms, a function\nbetween topological spaces is continuous in the sense above if and only if for all subsets \"A\" of \"X\"\nThat is to say, given any element \"x\" of \"X\" that is in the closure of any subset \"A\", \"f\"(\"x\") belongs to the closure of \"f\"(\"A\"). This is equivalent to the requirement that for all subsets \"A\"<nowiki>'</nowiki> of \"X\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>\nMoreover,\nis continuous if and only if\nfor any subset \"A\"' of \"Y\".\n\nIf \"f\": \"X\" → \"Y\" and \"g\": \"Y\" → \"Z\" are continuous, then so is the composition \"g\" ∘ \"f\": \"X\" → \"Z\". If \"f\": \"X\" → \"Y\" is continuous and\n\nThe possible topologies on a fixed set \"X\" are partially ordered: a topology τ is said to be coarser than another topology τ (notation: τ ⊆ τ) if every open subset with respect to τ is also open with respect to τ. Then, the identity map\nis continuous if and only if τ ⊆ τ (see also comparison of topologies). More generally, a continuous function\nstays continuous if the topology τ is replaced by a coarser topology and/or τ is replaced by a finer topology.\n\nSymmetric to the concept of a continuous map is an open map, for which \"images\" of open sets are open. In fact, if an open map \"f\" has an inverse function, that inverse is continuous, and if a continuous map \"g\" has an inverse, that inverse is open. Given a bijective function \"f\" between two topological spaces, the inverse function \"f\" need not be continuous. A bijective continuous function with continuous inverse function is called a \"homeomorphism\".\n\nIf a continuous bijection has as its domain a compact space and its codomain is Hausdorff, then it is a homeomorphism.\n\nGiven a function\nwhere \"X\" is a topological space and \"S\" is a set (without a specified topology), the final topology on \"S\" is defined by letting the open sets of \"S\" be those subsets \"A\" of \"S\" for which \"f\"(\"A\") is open in \"X\". If \"S\" has an existing topology, \"f\" is continuous with respect to this topology if and only if the existing topology is coarser than the final topology on \"S\". Thus the final topology can be characterized as the finest topology on \"S\" that makes \"f\" continuous. If \"f\" is surjective, this topology is canonically identified with the quotient topology under the equivalence relation defined by \"f\".\n\nDually, for a function \"f\" from a set \"S\" to a topological space, the initial topology on \"S\" has as open subsets \"A\" of \"S\" those subsets for which \"f\"(\"A\") is open in \"X\". If \"S\" has an existing topology, \"f\" is continuous with respect to this topology if and only if the existing topology is finer than the initial topology on \"S\". Thus the initial topology can be characterized as the coarsest topology on \"S\" that makes \"f\" continuous. If \"f\" is injective, this topology is canonically identified with the subspace topology of \"S\", viewed as a subset of \"X\".\n\nA topology on a set \"S\" is uniquely determined by the class of all continuous functions formula_81 into all topological spaces \"X\". Dually, a similar idea can be applied to maps formula_82\n\nVarious other mathematical domains use the concept of continuity in different, but related meanings. For example, in order theory, an order-preserving function \"f\": \"X\" → \"Y\" between particular types of partially ordered sets \"X\" and \"Y\" is continuous if for each directed subset \"A\" of \"X\", we have sup(\"f\"(\"A\")) = \"f\"(sup(\"A\")). Here sup is the supremum with respect to the orderings in \"X\" and \"Y\", respectively. This notion of continuity is the same as topological continuity when the partially ordered sets are given the Scott topology.\n\nIn category theory, a functor\nbetween two categories is called \"continuous\", if it commutes with small limits. That is to say,\nfor any small (i.e., indexed by a set \"I\", as opposed to a class) diagram of objects in formula_85.\n\nA \"continuity space\" is a generalization of metric spaces and posets, which uses the concept of quantales, and that can be used to unify the notions of metric spaces and domains.\n\n"}
{"id": "6123", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6123", "title": "Curl (mathematics)", "text": "Curl (mathematics)\n\nIn vector calculus, the curl is a vector operator that describes the infinitesimal rotation of a vector field in three-dimensional Euclidean space. At every point in the field, the curl of that point is represented by a vector. The attributes of this vector (length and direction) characterize the rotation at that point.\n\nThe direction of the curl is the axis of rotation, as determined by the right-hand rule, and the magnitude of the curl is the magnitude of rotation. If the vector field represents the flow velocity of a moving fluid, then the curl is the circulation density of the fluid. A vector field whose curl is zero is called irrotational. The curl is a form of differentiation for vector fields. The corresponding form of the fundamental theorem of calculus is Stokes' theorem, which relates the surface integral of the curl of a vector field to the line integral of the vector field around the boundary curve.\n\nThe alternative terminology \"rotor\", \"rotation\" or \"rotational\" and alternative notations and are often used (the former especially in many European countries, the latter, using the del (or nabla) operator and the cross product, is more used in other countries) for .\n\nUnlike the gradient and divergence, curl does not generalize as simply to other dimensions; some generalizations are possible, but only in three dimensions is the geometrically defined curl of a vector field again a vector field. This is a similar phenomenon as in the 3 dimensional cross product, and the connection is reflected in the notation for the curl.\n\nThe name \"curl\" was first suggested by James Clerk Maxwell in 1871 but the concept was apparently first used in the construction of an optical field theory by James MacCullagh in 1839.\n\nThe curl of a vector field , denoted by , or , or , at a point is defined in terms of its projection onto various lines through the point. If is any unit vector, the projection of the curl of onto is defined to be the limiting value of a closed line integral in a plane orthogonal to as the path used in the integral becomes infinitesimally close to the point, divided by the area enclosed.\n\nAs such, the curl operator maps continuously differentiable functions to continuous functions . In fact, it maps functions in to functions in . \n\nImplicitly, curl is defined by:\n\nwhere is a line integral along the boundary of the area in question, and is the magnitude of the area. If is the unit vector perpendicular to the plane, whereas is an outward-pointing in-plane normal (see caption at right), then the orientation of is chosen so that a tangent vector to is positively oriented if and only if forms a positively oriented basis for (right-hand rule).\n\nThe above formula means that the curl of a vector field is defined as the infinitesimal area density of the \"circulation\" of that field. To this definition fit naturally \n\nNote that the equation for each component, can be obtained by exchanging each occurrence of a subscript 1, 2, 3 in cyclic permutation: 1→2, 2→3, and 3→1 (where the subscripts represent the relevant indices).\n\nIf are the Cartesian coordinates and are the orthogonal coordinates, then \nis the length of the coordinate vector corresponding to . The remaining two components of curl result from cyclic permutation of indices: 3,1,2 → 1,2,3 → 2,3,1.\n\nSuppose the vector field describes the velocity field of a fluid flow (such as a large tank of liquid or gas) and a small ball is located within the fluid or gas (the centre of the ball being fixed at a certain point). If the ball has a rough surface, the fluid flowing past it will make it rotate. The rotation axis (oriented according to the right hand rule) points in the direction of the curl of the field at the centre of the ball, and the angular speed of the rotation is half the magnitude of the curl at this point.\n\nIn practice, the above definition is rarely used because in virtually all cases, the curl operator can be applied using some set of curvilinear coordinates, for which simpler representations have been derived.\n\nThe notation has its origins in the similarities to the 3-dimensional cross product, and it is useful as a mnemonic in Cartesian coordinates if is taken as a vector differential operator del. Such notation involving operators is common in physics and algebra. However, in certain coordinate systems, such as polar-toroidal coordinates (common in plasma physics), using the notation will yield an incorrect result.\n\nExpanded in Cartesian coordinates (see Del in cylindrical and spherical coordinates for spherical and cylindrical coordinate representations), is, for composed of :\n\nwhere , , and are the unit vectors for the -, -, and -axes, respectively. This expands as follows:\n\nAlthough expressed in terms of coordinates, the result is invariant under proper rotations of the coordinate axes but the result inverts under reflection.\n\nIn a general coordinate system, the curl is given by\n\nwhere denotes the Levi-Civita tensor and the covariant derivative, the metric tensor is used to lower the index on , and the Einstein summation convention implies that repeated indices are summed over. Equivalently,\n\nwhere are the coordinate vector fields. Equivalently, using the exterior derivative, the curl can be expressed as:\n\nHere and are the musical isomorphisms, and is the Hodge dual. This formula shows how to calculate the curl of in any coordinate system, and how to extend the curl to any oriented three-dimensional Riemannian manifold. Since this depends on a choice of orientation, curl is a chiral operation. In other words, if the orientation is reversed, then the direction of the curl is also reversed.\n\nTake the vector field, which depends on and linearly:\n\nIts plot looks like this:\n\nSimply by visual inspection, we can see that the field is rotating. If we place a paddle wheel anywhere (with the shaft pointing vertically into the picture), we see immediately its tendency to rotate clockwise. Using the right-hand rule, we expect the curl to be into the page. If we are to keep a right-handed coordinate system, into the page will be in the negative direction. The lack of and directions is analogous to the cross product operation.\n\nIf we calculate the curl:\n\nWhich is indeed in the negative direction, as expected. In this case, the curl is actually a constant, irrespective of position. The \"amount\" of rotation in the above vector field is the same at any point . Plotting the curl of is not very interesting:\n\nSuppose we now consider a slightly more complicated vector field:\n\nIts plot:\n\nWe might not see any rotation initially, but if we closely look at the right, we see a larger field at, say, than at . Intuitively, if we placed a small paddle wheel there, the larger \"current\" on its right side would cause the paddlewheel to rotate clockwise, which corresponds to a curl in the negative direction. By contrast, if we look at a point on the left and placed a small paddle wheel there, the larger \"current\" on its left side would cause the paddlewheel to rotate counterclockwise, which corresponds to a curl in the positive direction. Let's check out our guess by doing the math:\n\nIndeed, the curl is in the positive direction for negative and in the negative direction for positive , as expected. Since this curl is not the same at every point, its plot is a bit more interesting:\n\nWe note that the plot of this curl has no dependence on or (as it shouldn't) and is in the negative direction for positive and in the positive direction for negative .\n\nIn general curvilinear coordinates (not only in Cartesian coordinates), the curl of a cross product of vector fields and can be shown to be\n\nInterchanging the vector field and operator, we arrive at the cross product of a vector field with curl of a vector field:\n\nwhere is the Feynman subscript notation, which considers only the variation due to the vector field (i.e., in this case, is treated as being constant in space).\n\nAnother example is the curl of a curl of a vector field. It can be shown that in general coordinates\n\nand this identity defines the vector Laplacian of , symbolized as .\n\nThe curl of the gradient of \"any\" scalar field is always the zero vector field\n\nwhich follows from the antisymmetry in the definition of the curl, and the symmetry of second derivatives.\n\nIf is a scalar valued function and is a vector field, then\n\n\nThe vector calculus operations of grad, curl, and div are most easily generalized and understood in the context of differential forms, which involves a number of steps. In a nutshell, they correspond to the derivatives of 0-forms, 1-forms, and 2-forms, respectively. The geometric interpretation of curl as rotation corresponds to identifying bivectors (2-vectors) in 3 dimensions with the special orthogonal Lie algebra of infinitesimal rotations (in coordinates, skew-symmetric 3 × 3 matrices), while representing rotations by vectors corresponds to identifying 1-vectors (equivalently, 2-vectors) and , these all being 3-dimensional spaces.\n\nIn 3 dimensions, a differential 0-form is simply a function ; a differential 1-form is the following expression:\na differential 2-form is the formal sum:\nand a differential 3-form is defined by a single term:\n\nThe exterior derivative of a -form in is defined as the -form from above—and in if, e.g.,\n\nthen the exterior derivative leads to\n\nThe exterior derivative of a 1-form is therefore a 2-form, and that of a 2-form is a 3-form. On the other hand, because of the interchangeability of mixed derivatives, e.g. because of\n\nthe twofold application of the exterior derivative leads to 0.\n\nThus, denoting the space of -forms by and the exterior derivative by one gets a sequence:\n\nHere is the space of sections of the exterior algebra vector bundle over ℝ, whose dimension is the binomial coefficient ; note that for or . Writing only dimensions, one obtains a row of Pascal's triangle:\n\nthe 1-dimensional fibers correspond to functions, and the 3-dimensional fibers to vector fields, as described below. Note that modulo suitable identifications, the three nontrivial occurrences of the exterior derivative correspond to grad, curl, and div.\n\nDifferential forms and the differential can be defined on any Euclidean space, or indeed any manifold, without any notion of a Riemannian metric. On a Riemannian manifold, or more generally pseudo-Riemannian manifold, -forms can be identified with -vector fields (-forms are -covector fields, and a pseudo-Riemannian metric gives an isomorphism between vectors and covectors), and on an \"oriented\" vector space with a nondegenerate form (an isomorphism between vectors and covectors), there is an isomorphism between -vectors and -vectors; in particular on (the tangent space of) an oriented pseudo-Riemannian manifold. Thus on an oriented pseudo-Riemannian manifold, one can interchange -forms, -vector fields, -forms, and -vector fields; this is known as Hodge duality. Concretely, on this is given by:\n\nThus, identifying 0-forms and 3-forms with functions, and 1-forms and 2-forms with vector fields:\n\nOn the other hand, the fact that corresponds to the identities\nfor any function , and\nfor any vector field .\n\nGrad and div generalize to all oriented pseudo-Riemannian manifolds, with the same geometric interpretation, because the spaces of 0-forms and -forms is always (fiberwise) 1-dimensional and can be identified with scalar functions, while the spaces of 1-forms and -forms are always fiberwise -dimensional and can be identified with vector fields.\n\nCurl does not generalize in this way to 4 or more dimensions (or down to 2 or fewer dimensions); in 4 dimensions the dimensions are\n\nso the curl of a 1-vector field (fiberwise 4-dimensional) is a \"2-vector field\", which is fiberwise 6-dimensional, one has\n\nwhich yields a sum of six independent terms, and cannot be identified with a 1-vector field. Nor can one meaningfully go from a 1-vector field to a 2-vector field to a 3-vector field (4 → 6 → 4), as taking the differential twice yields zero (). Thus there is no curl function from vector fields to vector fields in other dimensions arising in this way.\n\nHowever, one can define a curl of a vector field as a \"2-vector field\" in general, as described below.\n\n2-vectors correspond to the exterior power ; in the presence of an inner product, in coordinates these are the skew-symmetric matrices, which are geometrically considered as the special orthogonal Lie algebra of infinitesimal rotations. This has dimensions, and allows one to interpret the differential of a 1-vector field as its infinitesimal rotations. Only in 3 dimensions (or trivially in 0 dimensions) does , which is the most elegant and common case. In 2 dimensions the curl of a vector field is not a vector field but a function, as 2-dimensional rotations are given by an angle (a scalar – an orientation is required to choose whether one counts clockwise or counterclockwise rotations as positive); note that this is not the div, but is rather perpendicular to it. In 3 dimensions the curl of a vector field is a vector field as is familiar (in 1 and 0 dimensions the curl of a vector field is 0, because there are no non-trivial 2-vectors), while in 4 dimensions the curl of a vector field is, geometrically, at each point an element of the 6-dimensional Lie algebra .\n\nNote also that the curl of a 3-dimensional vector field which only depends on 2 coordinates (say and ) is simply a vertical vector field (in the direction) whose magnitude is the curl of the 2-dimensional vector field, as in the examples on this page.\n\nConsidering curl as a 2-vector field (an antisymmetric 2-tensor) has been used to generalize vector calculus and associated physics to higher dimensions.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6125", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6125", "title": "Carl Friedrich Gauss", "text": "Carl Friedrich Gauss\n\nJohann Carl Friedrich Gauss (; , ; ) (30 April 177723 February 1855) was a German mathematician who contributed significantly to many fields, including number theory, algebra, statistics, analysis, differential geometry, geodesy, geophysics, mechanics, electrostatics, astronomy, matrix theory, and optics.\n\nSometimes referred to as the \"Princeps mathematicorum\" (Latin, \"the foremost of mathematicians\") and \"greatest mathematician since antiquity\", Gauss had an exceptional influence in many fields of mathematics and science and is ranked as one of history's most influential mathematicians.\n\nJohann Carl Friedrich Gauss was born on 30 April 1777 in Brunswick (Braunschweig), in the Duchy of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel (now part of Lower Saxony, Germany), as the son of poor working-class parents. His mother was illiterate and never recorded the date of his birth, remembering only that he had been born on a Wednesday, eight days before the Feast of the Ascension, which itself occurs 39 days after Easter. Gauss later solved this puzzle about his birthdate in the context of finding the date of Easter, deriving methods to compute the date in both past and future years. He was christened and confirmed in a church near the school he attended as a child.\n\nGauss was a child prodigy. A contested story relates that, when he was eight, he figured out how to add up all the numbers from 1 to 100. There are many other anecdotes about his precocity while a toddler, and he made his first ground-breaking mathematical discoveries while still a teenager. He completed \"Disquisitiones Arithmeticae\", his magnum opus, in 1798 at the age of 21, although it was not published until 1801. This work was fundamental in consolidating number theory as a discipline and has shaped the field to the present day.\n\nGauss's intellectual abilities attracted the attention of the Duke of Brunswick, who sent him to the Collegium Carolinum (now Braunschweig University of Technology), which he attended from 1792 to 1795, and to the University of Göttingen from 1795 to 1798.\nWhile at university, Gauss independently rediscovered several important theorems. His breakthrough occurred in 1796 when he showed that a regular polygon can be constructed by compass and straightedge if and only if the number of sides is the product of distinct Fermat primes and a power of 2. This was a major discovery in an important field of mathematics; construction problems had occupied mathematicians since the days of the Ancient Greeks, and the discovery ultimately led Gauss to choose mathematics instead of philology as a career.\nGauss was so pleased by this result that he requested that a regular heptadecagon be inscribed on his tombstone. The stonemason declined, stating that the difficult construction would essentially look like a circle.\n\nThe year 1796 was most productive for both Gauss and number theory. He discovered a construction of the heptadecagon on 30 March. He further advanced modular arithmetic, greatly simplifying manipulations in number theory. On 8 April he became the first to prove the quadratic reciprocity law. This remarkably general law allows mathematicians to determine the solvability of any quadratic equation in modular arithmetic. The prime number theorem, conjectured on 31 May, gives a good understanding of how the prime numbers are distributed among the integers.\n\nGauss also discovered that every positive integer is representable as a sum of at most three triangular numbers on 10 July and then jotted down in his diary the note: \"ΕΥΡΗΚΑ! . On 1 October he published a result on the number of solutions of polynomials with coefficients in finite fields, which 150 years later led to the Weil conjectures.\n\nIn 1831 Gauss developed a fruitful collaboration with the physics professor Wilhelm Weber, leading to new knowledge in magnetism (including finding a representation for the unit of magnetism in terms of mass, charge, and time) and the discovery of Kirchhoff's circuit laws in electricity. It was during this time that he formulated his namesake law. They constructed the first electromechanical telegraph in 1833, which connected the observatory with the institute for physics in Göttingen. Gauss ordered a magnetic observatory to be built in the garden of the observatory, and with Weber founded the \"Magnetischer Verein\" (\"magnetic club\" in German), which supported measurements of Earth's magnetic field in many regions of the world. He developed a method of measuring the horizontal intensity of the magnetic field which was in use well into the second half of the 20th century, and worked out the mathematical theory for separating the inner and outer (magnetospheric) sources of Earth's magnetic field.\n\nIn 1840, Gauss published his influential \"Dioptrische Untersuchungen\", in which he gave the first systematic analysis on the formation of images under a paraxial approximation (Gaussian optics). Among his results, Gauss showed that under a paraxial approximation an optical system can be characterized by its cardinal points and he derived the Gaussian lens formula.\n\nIn 1845, he became associated member of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands; when that became the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1851, he joined as a foreign member.\n\nIn 1854, Gauss selected the topic for Bernhard Riemann's Habilitationvortrag, \"Über die Hypothesen, welche der Geometrie zu Grunde liegen\". On the way home from Riemann's lecture, Weber reported that Gauss was full of praise and excitement.\n\nGauss died in Göttingen, (then Kingdom of Hanover and now Lower Saxony) on 23 February 1855 and is interred in the Albani Cemetery there. Two individuals gave eulogies at his funeral: Gauss's son-in-law Heinrich Ewald and Wolfgang Sartorius von Waltershausen, who was Gauss's close friend and biographer. His brain was preserved and was studied by Rudolf Wagner who found its mass to be 1,492 grams (slightly above average) and the cerebral area equal to 219,588 square millimeters (340.362 square inches). Highly developed convolutions were also found, which in the early 20th century were suggested as the explanation of his genius.\n\nGauss was a Lutheran Protestant, a member of the St. Albans Evangelical Lutheran church in Göttingen. Potential evidence that Gauss believed in God comes from his response after solving a problem that had previously defeated him: \"Finally, two days ago, I succeeded— not on account of my hard efforts, but by the grace of the Lord.\" One of his biographers G. Waldo Dunnington describes Gauss's religious views in these terms:\nFor him science was the means of exposing the immortal nucleus of the human soul. In the days of his full strength it furnished him recreation and, by the prospects which it opened up to him, gave consolation. Toward the end of his life it brought him confidence. Gauss' God was not a cold and distant figment of metaphysics, nor a distorted caricature of embittered theology. To man is not vouchsafed that fullness of knowledge which would warrant his arrogantly holding that his blurred vision is the full light and that there can be none other which might report truth as does his. For Gauss, not he who mumbles his creed, but he who lives it, is accepted. He believed that a life worthily spent here on earth is the best, the only, preparation for heaven. Religion is not a question of literature, but of life. God's revelation is continuous, not contained in tablets of stone or sacred parchment. A book is inspired when it inspires. The unshakeable idea of personal continuance after death, the firm belief in a last regulator of things, in an eternal, just, omniscient, omnipotent God, formed the basis of his religious life, which harmonized completely with his scientific research.\n\nApart from his correspondence, there are not many known details about Gauss' personal creed. Many biographers of Gauss disagree with his religious stance, with Bühler and others considering him a deist with very unorthodox views, while Dunnington (though admitting that Gauss did not believe literally in all Christian dogmas and that it is unknown what he believed on most doctrinal and confessional questions) points out that he was, at least, a nominal Lutheran.\n\nIn connection to this, there is a record of a conversation between Rudolf Wagner and Gauss, in which they discussed William Whewell's book \"Of the Plurality of Worlds\". In this work, Whewell had discarded the possibility of existing life in other planets, on the basis of theological arguments, but this was a position with which both Wagner and Gauss disagreed. Later Wagner explained that he did not fully believe in the Bible, though he confessed that he \"envied\" those who were able to easily believe. This later led them to discuss the topic of faith, and in some other religious remarks, Gauss said that he had been more influenced by theologians like Lutheran minister Paul Gerhardt than by Moses. Other religious influences included Wilhelm Braubach, Johann Peter Süssmilch, and the New Testament.\n\nDunnington further elaborates on Gauss's religious views by writing: Gauss' religious consciousness was based on an insatiable thirst for truth and a deep feeling of justice extending to intellectual as well as material goods. He conceived spiritual life in the whole universe as a great system of law penetrated by eternal truth, and from this source he gained the firm confidence that death does not end all.\n\nGauss declared he firmly believed in the afterlife, and saw spirituality as something essentially important for human beings. He was quoted stating: \"\"The world would be nonsense, the whole creation an absurdity without immortality,\"\" and for this statement he was severely criticized by the atheist Eugen Dühring who judged him as a narrow superstitious man.\n\nThough he was not a church-goer, Gauss strongly upheld religious tolerance, believing \"that one is not justified in disturbing another's religious belief, in which they find consolation for earthly sorrows in time of trouble.\" When his son Eugene announced that he wanted to become a Christian missionary, Gauss approved of this, saying that regardless of the problems within religious organizations, missionary work was \"a highly honorable\" task.\n\nGauss's personal life was overshadowed by the early death of his first wife, Johanna Osthoff, in 1809, soon followed by the death of one child, Louis. Gauss plunged into a depression from which he never fully recovered. He married again, to Johanna's best friend, Friederica Wilhelmine Waldeck, commonly known as Minna. When his second wife died in 1831 after a long illness, one of his daughters, Therese, took over the household and cared for Gauss for the rest of his life. His mother lived in his house from 1817 until her death in 1839.\n\nGauss had six children. With Johanna (1780–1809), his children were Joseph (1806–1873), Wilhelmina (1808–1846) and Louis (1809–1810). With Minna Waldeck he also had three children: Eugene (1811–1896), Wilhelm (1813–1879) and Therese (1816–1864). Eugene shared a good measure of Gauss's talent in languages and computation. Therese kept house for Gauss until his death, after which she married.\n\nGauss eventually had conflicts with his sons. He did not want any of his sons to enter mathematics or science for \"fear of lowering the family name\", as he believed none of them would surpass his own achievements. Gauss wanted Eugene to become a lawyer, but Eugene wanted to study languages. They had an argument over a party Eugene held, which Gauss refused to pay for. The son left in anger and, in about 1832, emigrated to the United States, where he was quite successful. While working for the American Fur Company in the Midwest, he learned the Sioux language. Later, he moved to Missouri and became a successful businessman. Wilhelm also moved to America in 1837 and settled in Missouri, starting as a farmer and later becoming wealthy in the shoe business in St. Louis. It took many years for Eugene's success to counteract his reputation among Gauss's friends and colleagues. See also on 3 September 1912.\n\nCarl Gauss was an ardent perfectionist and a hard worker. He was never a prolific writer, refusing to publish work which he did not consider complete and above criticism. This was in keeping with his personal motto \"pauca sed matura\" (\"few, but ripe\"). His personal diaries indicate that he had made several important mathematical discoveries years or decades before his contemporaries published them. Mathematical historian Eric Temple Bell said that if Gauss had published all of his discoveries in a timely manner, he would have advanced mathematics by fifty years.\n\nThough he did take in a few students, Gauss was known to dislike teaching. It is said that he attended only a single scientific conference, which was in Berlin in 1828. However, several of his students became influential mathematicians, among them Richard Dedekind and Bernhard Riemann. \n\nOn Gauss's recommendation, Friedrich Bessel was awarded an honorary doctor degree from Göttingen in March 1811. Around that time, the two men engaged in an epistolary correspondence. However, when they met in person in 1825, they quarrelled; the details are not known.\n\nBefore she died, Sophie Germain was recommended by Gauss to receive her honorary degree; she never received it.\n\nGauss usually declined to present the intuition behind his often very elegant proofs—he preferred them to appear \"out of thin air\" and erased all traces of how he discovered them. This is justified, if unsatisfactorily, by Gauss in his \"Disquisitiones Arithmeticae\", where he states that all analysis (i.e., the paths one travelled to reach the solution of a problem) must be suppressed for sake of brevity.\n\nGauss supported the monarchy and opposed Napoleon, whom he saw as an outgrowth of revolution.\n\nIn his 1799 doctorate in absentia, \"A new proof of the theorem that every integral rational algebraic function of one variable can be resolved into real factors of the first or second degree\", Gauss proved the fundamental theorem of algebra which states that every non-constant single-variable polynomial with complex coefficients has at least one complex root. Mathematicians including Jean le Rond d'Alembert had produced false proofs before him, and Gauss's dissertation contains a critique of d'Alembert's work. Ironically, by today's standard, Gauss's own attempt is not acceptable, owing to implicit use of the Jordan curve theorem. However, he subsequently produced three other proofs, the last one in 1849 being generally rigorous. His attempts clarified the concept of complex numbers considerably along the way.\n\nGauss also made important contributions to number theory with his 1801 book \"Disquisitiones Arithmeticae\" (Latin, Arithmetical Investigations), which, among other things, introduced the symbol for congruence and used it in a clean presentation of modular arithmetic, contained the first two proofs of the law of quadratic reciprocity, developed the theories of binary and ternary quadratic forms, stated the class number problem for them, and showed that a regular heptadecagon (17-sided polygon) can be constructed with straightedge and compass.\n\nIn the same year, Italian astronomer Giuseppe Piazzi discovered the dwarf planet Ceres. Piazzi could only track Ceres for somewhat more than a month, following it for three degrees across the night sky. Then it disappeared temporarily behind the glare of the Sun. Several months later, when Ceres should have reappeared, Piazzi could not locate it: the mathematical tools of the time were not able to extrapolate a position from such a scant amount of data—three degrees represent less than 1% of the total orbit.\n\nGauss, who was 24 at the time, heard about the problem and tackled it. After three months of intense work, he predicted a position for Ceres in December 1801—just about a year after its first sighting—and this turned out to be accurate within a half-degree when it was rediscovered by Franz Xaver von Zach on 31 December at Gotha, and one day later by Heinrich Olbers in Bremen.\n\nGauss's method involved determining a conic section in space, given one focus (the Sun) and the conic's intersection with three given lines (lines of sight from the Earth, which is itself moving on an ellipse, to the planet) and given the time it takes the planet to traverse the arcs determined by these lines (from which the lengths of the arcs can be calculated by Kepler's Second Law). This problem leads to an equation of the eighth degree, of which one solution, the Earth's orbit, is known. The solution sought is then separated from the remaining six based on physical conditions. In this work Gauss used comprehensive approximation methods which he created for that purpose.\n\nOne such method was the fast Fourier transform. While this method is traditionally attributed to a 1965 paper by J. W. Cooley and J. W. Tukey, Gauss developed it as a trigonometric interpolation method. His paper, \"Theoria Interpolationis Methodo Nova Tractata\", was only published posthumously in Volume 3 of his collected works. This paper predates the first presentation by Joseph Fourier on the subject in 1807.\n\nZach noted that \"without the intelligent work and calculations of Doctor Gauss we might not have found Ceres again\". Though Gauss had up to that point been financially supported by his stipend from the Duke, he doubted the security of this arrangement, and also did not believe pure mathematics to be important enough to deserve support. Thus he sought a position in astronomy, and in 1807 was appointed Professor of Astronomy and Director of the astronomical observatory in Göttingen, a post he held for the remainder of his life.\nThe discovery of Ceres led Gauss to his work on a theory of the motion of planetoids disturbed by large planets, eventually published in 1809 as \"Theoria motus corporum coelestium in sectionibus conicis solem ambientum\" (Theory of motion of the celestial bodies moving in conic sections around the Sun). In the process, he so streamlined the cumbersome mathematics of 18th century orbital prediction that his work remains a cornerstone of astronomical computation. It introduced the Gaussian gravitational constant, and contained an influential treatment of the method of least squares, a procedure used in all sciences to this day to minimize the impact of measurement error.\n\nGauss proved the method under the assumption of normally distributed errors (see Gauss–Markov theorem; see also Gaussian). The method had been described earlier by Adrien-Marie Legendre in 1805, but Gauss claimed that he had been using it since 1794 or 1795. In the history of statistics, this disagreement is called the \"priority dispute over the discovery of the method of least squares.\"\n\nIn 1818 Gauss, putting his calculation skills to practical use, carried out a geodetic survey of the Kingdom of Hanover, linking up with previous Danish surveys. To aid the survey, Gauss invented the heliotrope, an instrument that uses a mirror to reflect sunlight over great distances, to measure positions.\n\nGauss also claimed to have discovered the possibility of non-Euclidean geometries but never published it. This discovery was a major paradigm shift in mathematics, as it freed mathematicians from the mistaken belief that Euclid's axioms were the only way to make geometry consistent and non-contradictory.\n\nResearch on these geometries led to, among other things, Einstein's theory of general relativity, which describes the universe as non-Euclidean. His friend Farkas Wolfgang Bolyai with whom Gauss had sworn \"brotherhood and the banner of truth\" as a student, had tried in vain for many years to prove the parallel postulate from Euclid's other axioms of geometry.\n\nBolyai's son, János Bolyai, discovered non-Euclidean geometry in 1829; his work was published in 1832. After seeing it, Gauss wrote to Farkas Bolyai: \"To praise it would amount to praising myself. For the entire content of the work ... coincides almost exactly with my own meditations which have occupied my mind for the past thirty or thirty-five years.\"\n\nThis unproved statement put a strain on his relationship with Bolyai who thought that Gauss was \"stealing\" his idea.\n\nLetters from Gauss years before 1829 reveal him obscurely discussing the problem of parallel lines. Waldo Dunnington, a biographer of Gauss, argues in \"Gauss, Titan of Science\" that Gauss was in fact in full possession of non-Euclidean geometry long before it was published by Bolyai, but that he refused to publish any of it because of his fear of controversy.\n\nThe geodetic survey of Hanover, which required Gauss to spend summers traveling on horseback for a decade, fueled Gauss's interest in differential geometry and topology, fields of mathematics dealing with curves and surfaces. Among other things he came up with the notion of Gaussian curvature. \nThis led in 1828 to an important theorem, the Theorema Egregium (\"remarkable theorem\"), establishing an important property of the notion of curvature. Informally, the theorem says that the curvature of a surface can be determined entirely by measuring angles and distances on the surface.\n\nThat is, curvature does not depend on how the surface might be embedded in 3-dimensional space or 2-dimensional space.\n\nIn 1821, he was made a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Gauss was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1822.\n\nThe British mathematician Henry John Stephen Smith (1826–1883) gave the following appraisal of Gauss:\nIf we except the great name of Newton it is probable that no mathematicians of any age or country have ever surpassed Gauss in the combination of an abundant fertility of invention with an absolute rigorousness in demonstration, which the ancient Greeks themselves might have envied.\nIt may seem paradoxical, but it is probably nevertheless true that it is precisely the efforts after logical perfection of form which has rendered the writings of Gauss open to the charge of obscurity and unnecessary difficulty.\nGauss says more than once that, for brevity, he gives only the synthesis, and suppresses the analysis of his propositions. If, on the other hand, we turn to a memoir of Euler's, there is a sort of free and luxuriant gracefulness about the whole performance, which tells of the quiet pleasure which Euler must have taken in each step of his work. It is not the least of Gauss' claims to the admiration of mathematicians, that, while fully penetrated with a sense of the vastness of the science, he exacted the utmost rigorousness in every part of it, never passed over a difficulty, as if it did not exist, and never accepted a theorem as true beyond the limits within which it could actually be demonstrated.\n\nThere are several stories of his early genius. According to one, his gifts became very apparent at the age of three when he corrected, mentally and without fault in his calculations, an error his father had made on paper while calculating finances.\n\nAnother story has it that in primary school after the young Gauss misbehaved, his teacher, J.G. Büttner, gave him a task: add a list of integers in arithmetic progression; as the story is most often told, these were the numbers from 1 to 100. The young Gauss reputedly produced the correct answer within seconds, to the astonishment of his teacher and his assistant Martin Bartels.\n\nGauss's presumed method was to realize that pairwise addition of terms from opposite ends of the list yielded identical intermediate sums: 1 + 100 = 101, 2 + 99 = 101, 3 + 98 = 101, and so on, for a total sum of 50 × 101 = 5050.\nHowever, the details of the story are at best uncertain (see for discussion of the original Wolfgang Sartorius von Waltershausen source and the changes in other versions); some authors, such as Joseph Rotman in his book \"A first course in Abstract Algebra\", question whether it ever happened.\n\nAccording to Isaac Asimov, Gauss was once interrupted in the middle of a problem and told that his wife was dying. He is purported to have said, \"Tell her to wait a moment till I'm done.\" This anecdote is briefly discussed in G. Waldo Dunnington's \"Gauss, Titan of Science\" where it is suggested that it is an apocryphal story.\n\nHe referred to mathematics as \"the queen of sciences\" and supposedly once espoused a belief in the necessity of immediately understanding Euler's identity as a benchmark pursuant to becoming a first-class mathematician.\n\nFrom 1989 through 2001, Gauss's portrait, a normal distribution curve and some prominent Göttingen buildings were featured on the German ten-mark banknote. The reverse featured the approach for Hanover. Germany has also issued three postage stamps honoring Gauss. One (no. 725) appeared in 1955 on the hundredth anniversary of his death; two others, nos. 1246 and 1811, in 1977, the 200th anniversary of his birth.\n\nDaniel Kehlmann's 2005 novel \"Die Vermessung der Welt\", translated into English as \"Measuring the World\" (2006), explores Gauss's life and work through a lens of historical fiction, contrasting them with those of the German explorer Alexander von Humboldt. A film version directed by Detlev Buck was released in 2012.\n\nIn 2007 a bust of Gauss was placed in the Walhalla temple.\n\nThings named in honor of Gauss include:\n\nIn 1929 the Polish mathematician Marian Rejewski, who helped to solve the German Enigma cipher machine in December 1932, began studying actuarial statistics at Göttingen. At the request of his Poznań University professor, Zdzisław Krygowski, on arriving at Göttingen Rejewski laid flowers on Gauss's grave.\n\n\nGauss's collective works are online at dz-srv1.sub.uni-goettingen.de Uni-goettingen.de includes German translations of Latin texts and commentaries by various authorities.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6130", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6130", "title": "Cornish language", "text": "Cornish language\n\nCornish (\"\") is a Southwestern Brittonic Celtic language native to Cornwall. The language began a revival in the early 20th century and is considered to be an important part of Cornish identity, culture and heritage. Cornish is currently a recognised minority language of the United Kingdom, protected under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, and has a growing number of second language speakers.\n\nAlong with Welsh and Breton, Cornish is descended directly from the Common Brittonic language spoken throughout much of Britain before the English language came to dominate. It was the main language of Cornwall for centuries until it was pushed westwards by English, maintaining close links with its sister language Breton with which it was mutually intelligible until well into the Middle Ages. Cornish continued to function as a common community language in parts of Cornwall until the late 18th century, and continued to be spoken in the home by some families into the 19th and possibly 20th centuries, overlapping the beginning of revival efforts. A process to revive the language was begun in the early 20th century, with a number of orthographical systems in use until a Standard Written Form was agreed upon in 2008. In 2010 UNESCO announced that its former classification of the language as \"extinct\" was \"no longer accurate\".\n\nSince the revival of the language, some Cornish textbooks and works of literature have been published and an increasing number of people are studying the language. Recent developments include Cornish music, independent films, and children's books. A small number of people in Cornwall have been brought up to be bilingual native speakers, and the language is taught in many schools. The first Cornish language crèche opened in 2010.\n\nCornish is one of the Brittonic languages, which constitute a branch of the Insular Celtic section of the Celtic language family. Brittonic also includes Welsh, Breton and the Cumbric language; the last is extinct. Scottish Gaelic, Irish and Manx are part of the separate Goidelic branch of Insular Celtic.\n\nJoseph Loth viewed Cornish and Breton as being two dialects of the same language, claiming that \"Middle Cornish is without doubt closer to Breton as a whole than the modern Breton dialect of Quiberon is to that of Saint-Pol-de-Léon.\"\n\nCornish evolved from the Common Brittonic spoken throughout Britain south of the Firth of Forth during the British Iron Age and Roman period. As a result of westward Anglo-Saxon expansion, the Britons of the southwest were separated from those in modern-day Wales and Cumbria. Some scholars have proposed that this split took place after the Battle of Deorham in about 577. The western dialects eventually evolved into modern Welsh and the now extinct Cumbric, while Southwestern Brittonic developed into Cornish and Breton, the latter as a result of immigration to parts of the continent, known as Brittany over the following centuries.\n\nThe area controlled by the southwestern Britons was progressively reduced by the expansion of Wessex over the next few centuries. During the Old Cornish period (800–1200), the Cornish-speaking area was largely coterminous with modern-day Cornwall; the region of Devon was isolated by Wessex in 936 AD and many inhabitants fled to Cornwall or Brittany. The earliest written record of the Cornish language comes from this period; a 9th-century gloss in a Latin manuscript of ' by Boethius, which used the words '. The phrase means \"it [the mind] hated the gloomy places\". A much more substantial survival from Old Cornish is a Cornish-Latin glossary (the Vocabularium Cornicum or Cottonian Vocabulary) containing translations of around 300 words. The manuscript was widely thought to be in Old Welsh until the 1700s when it was identified as Cornish. At this time there was still little difference between Welsh and Cornish, and even fewer differences between Cornish and Breton, with some scholars arguing that the terms \"Old Cornish\" and \"Old Breton\" are merely geographical terms for the same language.\n\nThe Cornish language continued to flourish well through the Middle Cornish period (1200–1600), reaching a peak of about 39,000 speakers in the 13th century, after which the number started to decline. This period provided the bulk of traditional Cornish literature, which was used to reconstruct the language during its revival. Most important is the \"Ordinalia\", a cycle of three mystery plays, \"Origo Mundi\", \"Passio Christi\" and \"Resurrexio Domini\". Together these provide about 20,000 lines of text. Various plays were written by the canons of Glasney College, intended to educate the Cornish people about the Bible and the Celtic saints. From this period also is ' and the recently discovered '.\n\nIn the reign of Henry VIII, an account was given by Andrew Boorde in his 1542 \"Boke of the Introduction of Knowledge\". He states, \"\"\n\nWhen Parliament passed the Act of Uniformity 1549, people in many areas of Cornwall did not speak or understand English. The intention of the Act was to replace worship in Latin with worship in English, which was known by the lawmakers not to be universally spoken throughout England. Instead of merely banning Latin, the Act was framed so as to enforce English. The Prayer Book Rebellion, which may also have been influenced by the retaliation of the English after the failed Cornish Rebellion of 1497, broke out, and was ruthlessly suppressed: over 4,000 people who protested against the imposition of an English prayer book were massacred by Edward VI's army. Their leaders were executed and the people suffered numerous reprisals.\n\nThe rebels' document claimed they wanted a return to the old religious services and ended, \"We the Cornishmen (whereof certain of us understand no English) utterly refuse this new English [altered spelling].\" Edward Seymour, Duke of Somerset, replied to the Cornishmen, inquiring as to why they should be offended by services in English when they had them in Latin, which they also did not understand.\nThrough many factors, including loss of life and the spread of English, the Prayer Book Rebellion proved a turning-point for the Cornish language. Indeed, some recent research has suggested that estimates of the Cornish-speaking population prior to the rebellion may have been low, making the decline even more drastic.\n\nPeter Berresford-Ellis cites the years 1550–1650 as a century of immense damage for the language, and its decline can be traced to this period. In 1680, William Scawen wrote an essay describing 16 reasons for the decline of Cornish, among them the lack of a distinctive Cornish alphabet, the loss of contact between Cornwall and Brittany, the cessation of the miracle plays, loss of records in the Civil War, lack of a Cornish bible, and immigration to Cornwall.\n\nBy the middle of the 17th century, the language had retreated to Penwith and Kerrier, and transmission of the language to new generations had almost entirely ceased. In his \"Survey of Cornwall\", published in 1602, Richard Carew writes:[M]ost of the inhabitants can speak no word of Cornish, but very few are ignorant of the English; and yet some so affect their own, as to a stranger they will not speak it; for if meeting them by chance, you inquire the way, or any such matter, your answer shall be, \",\" \"I [will] speak no Saxonage.\"\nThe Late Cornish period from 1578 to about 1800 has fewer sources of information on the language but they are more varied in nature. Written sources from this period are often spelled following English spelling conventions since the majority of writers of the time had had no exposure to Middle Cornish texts or the Cornish orthography within them, although after 1700 some writers began to adopt the orthography used by Edward Lhuyd in his Archaeologia Brittanica, for example using the circumflex to denote long vowels. In 1776, William Bodinar, who had learnt Cornish from fishermen, wrote a letter in Cornish which was probably the last prose in the language. However, the last verse was the \"Cranken Rhyme\", written in the late 19th century by John Davey of Boswednack.\n\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, there was intense academic and antiquarian interest in the language, particularly in the Middle Cornish literature, and also in attempting to find the last native speaker of the Cornish language. Despite the announcements of the death of the language, this academic interest, along with the beginning of the Celtic Revival in the late 19th century, provided the groundwork for a Cornish language revival movement.\n\nIn 1904, the Celtic language scholar and Cornish cultural activist Henry Jenner published \"A Handbook of the Cornish Language\". The publication of this book is often considered to be the point at which the revival movement started.\n\nThe revival focused on reconstructing and standardising the language, including coining new words for modern concepts, and creating educational material in order to teach Cornish to others. In 1929 Robert Morton Nance published his Unified Cornish system, based on the Middle Cornish literature while extending the attested vocabulary with forms based on Celtic roots also found in Breton and Welsh, publishing a dictionary in 1938. Nance's work became the basis of revived Cornish for most of the 20th century. However, as the revival grew in strength and focus shifted from written to spoken Cornish, Nance's stiff, archaic formulation of the language seemed less suitable for a spoken revival, and academic research into the traditional literature proved that the Unified system lacked some phonological distinctions.\n\nIn the 1980s, in response to dissatisfaction with Unified Cornish, Ken George published a new system, (\"Common Cornish\"). Like Unified Cornish, it retained a Middle Cornish base but implemented an orthography that aspired to be as phonemic as possible. It was subsequently adopted by the Cornish Language Board as well as by many Cornish speakers, but came under fierce criticism by academic linguists for its phonological base, as well as those who found its orthography too different from traditional Cornish spelling conventions. Also during this period, Richard Gendall created his Modern Cornish system (also known as \"Revived Late Cornish\"), which used Late Cornish as a basis, and Nicholas Williams published a revised version of Unified; however neither of these systems gained the popularity of Unified or Kemmyn.\n\nThe revival entered a period of factionalism and public disputes, with each orthography attempting to push the others aside. By the time that Cornish was recognised by the UK government under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages in 2002, it had become recognised that the existence of multiple orthographies was unsustainable with regards to using the language in education and public life, as none had achieved a wide consensus. A process of unification was set about which resulted in the creation of the public-body Cornish Language Partnership in 2005 and agreement on a Standard Written Form in 2008. In 2010 UNESCO altered its classification of Cornish, recognising that its previous label of \"extinct\" was no longer accurate. This was seen by Cornish speakers as a milestone, turning the language from a state of undergoing revival, to having been revived.\n\nThe modern-day Cornish language is a successfully revived language with a number of speakers that is slowly increasing, and is becoming more visible in Cornwall as local government and business are encouraged to make use of the language as part of revitalisation efforts.\n\nSpeakers of Cornish reside primarily in Cornwall which has a population of just 536,000 (2014). There are also some speakers living outside Cornwall, particularly in the countries of the Cornish diaspora, as well as other Celtic nations. Estimates of the number of Cornish speakers vary according to the definition of being a speaker, and is difficult to accurately determine due to the individualised nature of language take-up. Nevertheless, there is recognition that the number of Cornish speakers is growing. One figure for the mean number of people who know a few basic words, such as knowing that \"Kernow\" means \"Cornwall\", was 300,000; the same survey gave the figure of people able to have simple conversations at 3,000. The Cornish Language Strategy project commissioned research to provide quantitative and qualitative evidence for the number of Cornish speakers: due to the success of the revival project it was estimated that 2,000 people were fluent (surveyed in spring 2008), an increase from the estimated 300 people who spoke Cornish fluently suggested in a study by Kenneth MacKinnon in 2000.<ref name=\"BBC BBC/British Council\"></ref> In the 2011 UK census, 557 people in England and Wales declared Cornish to be their main language, 464 of whom lived in Cornwall.\n\nCornish is officially recognised as a minority language by the UK government under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, a status it has held since 2002. The Cornish Language Partnership is the official body for promotion and development of the language in Cornwall.\n\nCornwall Council's policy is to support the language. A motion passed in November 2009 approved the council's use of Cornish. The policy notes the \"place of the Cornish language as a unique cultural asset\" and requires the council to promote Cornish in line with the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. One effect of the policy is that worn out road signs are replaced by bilingual ones, but this plan has drawn some criticism.\n\nIn October 2015, Cornwall County Council announced that staff would be encouraged to use \"basic words and phrases\" in Cornish when dealing with the public.\nIn 2014 the Cornish people were recognised by the UK Government as a national minority under the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities. The FCNM provides certain rights and protections to a national minority with regard to their minority language.\n\nUNESCO's \"Atlas of World Languages\" classifies Cornish as \"critically endangered\". UNESCO has acknowledged that a previous classification of \"extinct\", which came under fierce criticism from Cornish speakers, \"does not reflect the current situation for Cornish\".\n\nIn 2016, national government funding for the Cornish language ceased, and responsibility transferred to Cornwall council.\n\nThe phonology of modern Cornish is based on a number of sources. The work of the linguist Edward Lhuyd who visited Cornwall in 1700 to record the language, as well as the modern Cornish dialect and accent of English, which got much of its intonation and sounds from the Cornish language, have provided a major source of input. Analysis of the traditional literature has also been used, as the Middle Cornish plays were often written in rhyming verse, and Late Cornish texts were written phonetically following English spelling conventions.\n\nThe grammar of Cornish shares with other Celtic languages a number of features which, while not unique, are unusual in an Indo-European context. The grammatical features most unfamiliar to English speakers of the language are the initial consonant mutations, the verb–subject–object word order, inflected prepositions, fronting of emphasised syntactic elements, and the use of two different forms for \"to be\". Cornish nouns belong to one of two grammatical genders, masculine and feminine, but are not inflected for case. Cornish has a variety of different endings to indicate the plural, and some nouns have a third collective form. Verbs are conjugated for tense and mood, which can be indicated either by inflection of the main verb, or by the use of auxiliary verbs. In Cornish vocabulary, a large number of the lexical items are language and culture specific. Examples of these include the Cornish word ', which means \"mine waste\" and the word ', which means \"to mend fishing nets\". ' and ' are different types of pastry cakes. ' is culture specific when referring to \"a traditional Cornish dance get-together\", while ' is a specific kind of ceremonial dance that takes place in Cornwall.\n\nIn contrast, Cornish translates the English noun, \"book\", as ' (cognate with Welsh ', but \"\" can actually be translated into English as \"book\" or \"volume\" because it can be considered one in a set of books.\n\nAs in other Celtic languages, Cornish lacks a number of verbs that are commonly found in other languages. This includes modals and psych-verbs; examples \"have\", \"like\", \"hate\", \"prefer\", \"must\"/\"have to\", \"make\"/\"compel to\". These functions are instead fulfilled by periphrastic constructions involving a verb and various prepositional phrases.\n\n\nThe Celtic Congress and Celtic League are groups that advocate cooperation amongst the Celtic Nations in order to protect and promote Celtic languages and cultures, thus working in the interests of the Cornish language.\n\nThere have been films such as \"\", some televised, made entirely, or significantly, in the language. Some businesses use Cornish names.\n\nAccording to the sociologist Kenneth MacKinnon, Jenner wrote \"There has never been a time when there has been no person in Cornwall without a knowledge of the Cornish language.\"\n\nCornish has significantly and durably affected Cornwall's place names, as well as in Cornish surnames, and knowledge of the language helps the understanding of these ancient meanings. Cornish names are adopted for children, pets, houses and boats.\n\nThere is Cornish literature, in which poetry is the most important genre, particularly in oral form or as song or as traditional Cornish chants historically performed in marketplaces during religious holidays and public festivals and gatherings.\n\nThere are periodicals solely in the language such as the monthly ', ', and \"\". BBC Radio Cornwall has a news broadcast in Cornish, and sometimes has other programmes and features for learners and enthusiasts. Local newspapers such as the \"Western Morning News\" have articles in Cornish, and newspapers such as \"The Packet\", \"The West Briton\" and \"The Cornishman\" have also been known to have Cornish features. There is an online radio service in Cornish called , publishing a one-hour podcast each week, based on a magazine format. It includes music in Cornish as well as interviews and features.\n\nThe language has financial sponsorship from sources, including the Millennium Commission. A number of language organisations exist in Cornwall: (Our Language), the Cornish sub-group of the European Bureau for Lesser-Used Languages, , (the Cornish Language Board) and (the Cornish Language Fellowship)]. There are ceremonies, some ancient, some modern, which use the language or are entirely in the language.\n\nThough estimations of the number of Cornish speakers vary, the speakers of Cornish today are thought to be around five hundred. Currently, Cornish is spoken by its speakers at home, outside the home, in the workplace, and at ritual ceremonies. Cornish is also being used in the arts. Revived Cornish is constructed on historical Cornish, so that the Cornish language develops. English language has had some effect in this development. Regardless of having \"no concrete purpose during the twentieth century,\" the number of Cornish speakers has gradually increased.\n\nThe Celtic Congress and Celtic League are groups that advocate cooperation amongst the Celtic Nations in order to protect and promote Celtic languages and cultures, thus working in the interests of the Cornish language. Cornish has significantly and durably affected Cornwall's place names, as well as in Cornish surnames, and knowledge of the language helps the understanding of these ancient meanings. Cornish names are adopted for children, pets, houses and boats. There are periodicals solely in the language such as the monthly \"An Gannas\", \"An Gowsva\", and \"An Garrick\". BBC Radio Cornwall has a news broadcast in Cornish, and sometimes has other programmes and features for learners and enthusiasts. Local newspapers such as the \"Western Morning News\" have articles in Cornish, and newspapers such as \"The Packet\", \"The West Briton\" and \"The Cornishman\" have also been known to have Cornish features. The language has financial sponsorship from sources, including the Millennium Commission. A number of language organisations exist in Cornwall: Agan Tavas (Our Language), the Cornish sub-group of the European Bureau for Lesser-Used Languages, Gorsedh Kernow, Kesva an Taves Kernewek (the Cornish Language Board) and Kowethas an Yeth Kernewek (the Cornish Language Fellowship)].\n\nCornwall has had cultural events associated with the language, including the international Celtic Media Festival, hosted in St Ives in 1997. The Old Cornwall Society has promoted the use of the language at events and meetings. Two examples of ceremonies that are performed in both the English and Cornish languages are Crying the Neck and the annual mid-summer bonfires.\n\nCornish is taught in some schools; it was previously taught at degree level in the University of Wales, though the only existing course in the language at University level is as part of a course in Cornish Studies at the University of Exeter. In March 2008, a course in the language was started as part of the Celtic Studies curriculum at the University of Vienna, Austria.\nThe University of Cambridge offers courses in Cornish through its John Trim Resources Centre, which is part of its Language Centre. In addition, the Department of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic (which is part of the faculty of English), also carries out research into to the Cornish language.\n\nIn 2015 a university level course aiming to encourage and support practitioners working with young children to introduce the Cornish language into their settings was launched. The \"Cornish Language Practice Project (Early Years)\" is a level 4 course approved by Plymouth polytechnic and run at Cornwall College. The course is not a Cornish language course, but students will be assessed on their ability to use the Cornish language constructively in their work with young children. The course will cover such topics as \"Understanding Bilingualism\", \"Creating Resources\" and \"Integrating Language and Play\", but the focus of the language provision will be on Cornish. A non-accredited specialist Cornish language course has been developed to run alongside the level 4 course for those who prefer tutor support to learn the language or develop their skills further for use with young children.\n\nCornwall's first Cornish language crèche, \"\", was established in 2010 at Cornwall College, Camborne. The nursery teaches children aged between two and five years alongside their parents to ensure the language is also spoken in the home.\n\nA number of dictionaries are available in the different orthographies (a dictionary in the Standard Written Form has yet to be published), including ' by Ken George, ' by Nicholas Williams and \"A Practical Dictionary of Modern Cornish\" by Richard Gendall. Course books include the three-part ' series, ', ' and ', as well as the more recent ' and '.\n\nWilliam Scawen produced a manuscript on the declining Cornish language that continually evolved until he died in 1689, aged 89. He was the first person to realise the language was dying out and wrote detailed manuscripts which he started working on when he was 78. The only version that was ever published was a short first draft, but the final version, which he worked on until his death, is a few hundred pages long. At the same time a group of scholars, led by John Keigwin (nephew of William Scawen), of Mousehole, tried to preserve and further the Cornish language. They left behind a large number of translations of parts of the Bible, proverbs and songs. This group was contacted by the Welsh linguist Edward Lhuyd who came to Cornwall to study the language.\n\nEarly Modern Cornish was the subject of a study published by Lhuyd in 1707, and differs from the medieval language in having a considerably simpler structure and grammar. Such differences included the wide use of certain modal affixes that, although out of use by Lhuyd's time, had a considerable effect on the word-order of medieval Cornish. The medieval language also possessed two additional tenses for expressing past events and an extended set of possessive suffixes.\n\nJohn Whitaker, the Manchester-born rector of Ruan Lanihorne, studied the decline of the Cornish language. In his 1804 work \"the Ancient Cathedral of Cornwall\" he concluded that: \"[T]he English Liturgy, was not desired by the Cornish, but forced upon them by the tyranny of England, at a time when the English language owas yet unknown in Cornwall. This act of tyranny was at once gross barbarity to the Cornish people, and a death blow to the Cornish language.\".\n\nRobert Williams published the first comprehensive Cornish dictionary in 1865, the \"Lexicon Cornu-Britannicum\". As a result of the discovery of additional ancient Cornish manuscripts, 2000 new words were added to the vocabulary by Whitley Stokes in \"A Cornish Glossary\". William C. Borlase published \"Proverbs and Rhymes in Cornish\" in 1866 while \"A Glossary of Cornish Place Names\" was produced by John Bannister in the same year. Frederick Jago published his \"English–Cornish Dictionary\" in 1882.\n\nIn 2002, the Cornish language gained new recognition because of the European Charter for Regional and Minority Languages. Conversely, along with government provision was the governmental basis of \"New Public Management,\" measuring quantifiable results as means of determining effectiveness. This put enormous pressure on finding a single orthography that could be used in unison. The revival of Cornish required extensive rebuilding. The Cornish orthographies that were reconstructed may be considered versions of Cornish because they are not traditional sociolinguistic variations. In the middle-to-late twentieth century, the debate over Cornish orthographies angered more people because several language groups received public funding. This caused other groups to sense favouritism as playing a role in the debate.\n\nA governmental policymaking structure called New Public Management (NPM) has helped the Cornish language by managing public life of the Cornish language and people. In 2007, the Cornish Language Partnership MAGA represents separate divisions of government and their purpose is to further enhance the Cornish Language Developmental Plan. MAGA established an \"Ad-Hoc Group,\" which resulted in three orthographies being presented. The relations for the Ad-Hoc Group were to obtain consensus among the three orthographies, and then develop a \"single written form.\" The end result was creating a new form of Cornish, which had to be natural for both new learners and skilled speakers.\n\nIn 1981, the Breton library ' edited ' (Passion of our lord), a 15th-century Cornish poem. The first complete translation of the Bible into Cornish translated from English, was published in 2011. Another Bible translation project translating from original languages is underway. The New Testament and Psalms were posted on-line on YouVersion (Bible.com) and Bibles.org in July 2014 by the Bible Society.\n\nA few small publishers produce books in Cornish which are stocked in some local bookshops, as well as in Cornish branches of Waterstones and WH Smiths, although newer publications are becoming increasingly available on the Internet. The Truro Waterstones hosts the annual \"\" literary awards, established by to recognise publications relating to Cornwall or in the Cornish language. In recent years, a number of Cornish translations of literature has been published, including \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" (2009), \"Around the World in Eighty Days\" (2009), \"Treasure Island\" (2010), \"The Railway Children\" (2012), \"Hound of the Baskervilles\" (2012), \"War of the Worlds\" (2012), \"The Wind in the Willows\" (2013), \"Three Men in a Boat\" (2013), \"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass\" (2014), and \"A Christmas Carol\" (which won the 2012 award for Cornish Language books), as well as original Cornish literature such as ' (\"The Lyonesse Stone\") by Craig Weatherhill. Literature aimed at children is also available, such as ' (\"Where's Spot?\"), ' (\"The Beast of Bodmin Moor\"), three \"Topsy and Tim\" titles, and ' (\"Briallen and the Alien\"), which won the 2015 award for Cornish Language books for children. In 2014 \"\", Nicholas Williams' translation of J.R.R. Tolkien's \"The Hobbit\" was published.\n\nAn Gannas is a monthly magazine published entirely in the Cornish language. Members contribute articles on various subjects. The magazine is produced by Graham Sandercock who has been its editor since 1976.\n\nIn 1983 BBC Radio Cornwall started broadcasting around two minutes of Cornish every week. In 1987, however, they gave over 15 minutes of airtime on Sunday mornings for a programme called ' (\"Holdall\"), presented by John King, running until the early 1990s. It was eventually replaced with a five-minute news bulletin called ' (\"The News\"). The bulletin was presented every Sunday evening for many years by Rod Lyon, then Elizabeth Stewart, and currently a team presents in rotation. Pirate FM ran short bulletins on Saturday lunchtimes from 1998 to 1999. In 2006, Matthew Clarke who had presented the Pirate FM bulletin, launched a web-streamed news bulletin called ' (\"Weekly News\"), which in 2008 was merged into a new weekly magazine podcast ' (RanG).\n\nCornish television shows have included a 1982 series by Westward Television each episode containing a three-minute lesson in Cornish. ', an eight episode series produced by Television South West and broadcast between June and July 1984, later on S4C from May to July 1985, and as a schools programme in 1986. Also by Television South West were two bilingual programmes on Cornish Culture called '\nIn 2016 Kelly's Ice Cream of Bodmin introduced a light hearted television commercial in the Cornish language and this has been repeated in 2017.\n\nEnglish composer Peter Warlock, an enthusiast of the Celtic languages, wrote a Christmas carol in Cornish (setting words by Henry Jenner). Cornish musician Jory Bennett (born Redruth, 1963) has composed \"Six Songs of Cornwall\" for bass and piano, a Cornish song-cycle, settings of Cornish language poems by Nicholas Williams /trans. E. G. Retallack Hooper (f.p. Keele University, 7 May 1986). The Cornish electronic musician Richard D James has often used Cornish names for track titles, most notably on his \"DrukQs\" album. Gwenno Saunders is a multilingual Welsh-born musician and a Cornish speaker. Skwardya has produced four CD albums in Cornish in a modern pop/rock/blues/dance style.\n\nA number of traditional Cornish folk songs have been preserved, including \"An Awhesyth\", \"Bro Goth agan Tasow\", and \"Delkiow Sivy\".\n\nThe Cornish language has influenced the toponomy of Cornwall, and has historically been used in surnames for the Cornish people. Well before the agreement of the SWF in the 21st century, Late Cornish orthography in the Early Modern period usually followed Welsh/English transliteration so phonetically rendering C for K, I for Y, U for W, and Z for S rendering place names such as Porthcurno in place of SWF \"Porth Kernow\" and Penzance in place of \"Pen Sans\" to be adopted into English and words such as Enys (\"island\") can be found spelled as \"Ince\" as at Ince Castle. These apparent mistranslations can however reveal an insight into how names and places were actually pronounced explaining, for example, how anglicised Launceston is still pronounced \"Lann-zan\" from Cornish \"Lann Stefan\" with emphasis on the first element.\n\nThe following tables present some examples of Cornish placenames and surnames, and their anglicised versions:\n\nFrom the Universal Declaration of Human Rights:\n\nFrom \", the Cornish anthem:\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6134", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6134", "title": "Charybdis", "text": "Charybdis\n\nCharybdis (; Ancient Greek: Χάρυβδις, , \"Kharybdis\") was a sea monster, later rationalized as a whirlpool and considered a shipping hazard in the Strait of Messina.\n\nThe sea monster Charybdis was believed to live under a small rock on one side of a narrow channel. Opposite her was Scylla, another sea monster, that lived inside a much larger rock. [Odyssey, Book XII] The sides of the strait were within an arrow-shot of each other, and sailors attempting to avoid one of them would come in reach of the other. To be \"between Scylla and Charybdis\" therefore means to be presented with two opposite dangers, the task being to find a route that avoids both. Thrice a day, Charybdis swallowed a huge amount of water, before belching it back out again, creating large whirlpools capable of dragging a ship underwater. In some variations of the story, Charybdis was simply a large whirlpool instead of a sea monster.\n\nThe theoretical size of Charybdis remains unknown, yet in order to consume Greek ships the whirlpool can be estimated to about 23 meters (75 ft) across. Charybdis has been associated with the Strait of Messina, off the coast of Sicily and opposite a rock on the mainland identified with Scylla. Were Charybdis to be located in the Strait of Messina it would in fact have the size to accommodate the whirlpool. A whirlpool does exist there, caused by currents meeting, but it is dangerous only to small craft in extreme conditions.\n\nA later myth makes Charybdis the daughter of Poseidon and Gaia and living as a loyal servant to her father.\n\nCharybdis aided her father Poseidon in his feud with her paternal uncle Zeus and, as such, helped him engulf lands and islands in water. Zeus, angry for the land she stole from him, captured and chained her to the sea-bed. Charybdis was then cursed by the god into a hideous bladder of a monster, with flippers for arms and legs, and an uncontrollable thirst for the sea. As such, she drank the water from the sea thrice a day to quench it, which created whirlpools. She lingered on a rock with Scylla facing her directly on another rock, making a strait.\n\n Odysseus faced both Charybdis and Scylla while rowing through a narrow channel. He ordered his men to avoid Charybdis, thus forcing them to pass near Scylla, which resulted in the deaths of six of his men. Later, stranded on a raft, Odysseus was swept back through the strait and passed near Charybdis. His raft was sucked into her maw, but he survived by clinging to a fig tree growing on a rock over her lair. On the next outflow of water, when his raft was expelled, Odysseus recovered it and paddled away safely.\n\nThe Argonauts were able to avoid both dangers because Hera ordered the Nereid nymph Thetis, Achilles' mother, to guide them through the perilous passage.\n\nAristotle mentions in his \"Meteorologica\" that Aesop once teased a ferryman by telling him a myth concerning Charybdis. With one gulp of the sea she brought the mountains to view; islands appeared after the next. The third is yet to come and will dry the sea altogether, thus depriving the ferryman of his livelihood.\n\n"}
{"id": "6136", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6136", "title": "Carbon monoxide", "text": "Carbon monoxide\n\nCarbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas that is slightly less dense than air. It is toxic to hemoglobic animals (both invertebrate and vertebrate, including humans) when encountered in concentrations above about 35 ppm, although it is also produced in normal animal metabolism in low quantities, and is thought to have some normal biological functions. In the atmosphere, it is spatially variable and short lived, having a role in the formation of ground-level ozone.\n\nCarbon monoxide consists of one carbon atom and one oxygen atom, connected by a triple bond that consists of two covalent bonds as well as one dative covalent bond. It is the simplest oxocarbon and is isoelectronic with the cyanide anion, the nitrosonium cation and molecular nitrogen. In coordination complexes the carbon monoxide ligand is called carbonyl.\n\nAristotle (384–322 BC) first recorded that burning coals produced toxic fumes. An ancient method of execution was to shut the criminal in a bathing room with smoldering coals. What was not known was the mechanism of death. Greek physician Galen (129–199 AD) speculated that there was a change in the composition of the air that caused harm when inhaled. In 1776, the French chemist de Lassone produced CO by heating zinc oxide with coke, but mistakenly concluded that the gaseous product was hydrogen, as it burned with a blue flame. The gas was identified as a compound containing carbon and oxygen by the Scottish chemist William Cumberland Cruikshank in 1800. Its toxic properties on dogs were thoroughly investigated by Claude Bernard around 1846.\n\nDuring World War II, a gas mixture including carbon monoxide was used to keep motor vehicles running in parts of the world where gasoline and diesel fuel were scarce. External (with a few exceptions) charcoal or wood gas generators were fitted, and the mixture of atmospheric nitrogen, carbon monoxide, and small amounts of other gases produced by gasification was piped to a gas mixer. The gas mixture produced by this process is known as wood gas. Carbon monoxide was also used on a large scale during the Holocaust at some Nazi German extermination camps, the most notable by gas vans in Chełmno, and in the Action T4 \"euthanasia\" program.\n\nCarbon monoxide is produced from the partial oxidation of carbon-containing compounds; it forms when there is not enough oxygen to produce carbon dioxide (CO), such as when operating a stove or an internal combustion engine in an enclosed space. In the presence of oxygen, including atmospheric concentrations, carbon monoxide burns with a blue flame, producing carbon dioxide. Coal gas, which was widely used before the 1960s for domestic lighting, cooking, and heating, had carbon monoxide as a significant fuel constituent. Some processes in modern technology, such as iron smelting, still produce carbon monoxide as a byproduct.\n\nWorldwide, the largest source of carbon monoxide is natural in origin, due to photochemical reactions in the troposphere that generate about 5 kilograms per year. Other natural sources of CO include volcanoes, forest fires, and other forms of combustion.\n\nIn biology, carbon monoxide is naturally produced by the action of heme oxygenase 1 and 2 on the heme from hemoglobin breakdown. This process produces a certain amount of carboxyhemoglobin in normal persons, even if they do not breathe any carbon monoxide. Following the first report that carbon monoxide is a normal neurotransmitter in 1993, as well as one of three gases that naturally modulate inflammatory responses in the body (the other two being nitric oxide and hydrogen sulfide), carbon monoxide has received a great deal of clinical attention as a biological regulator. In many tissues, all three gases are known to act as anti-inflammatories, vasodilators, and promoters of neovascular growth. Clinical trials of small amounts of carbon monoxide as a drug are ongoing. Too much carbon monoxide causes carbon monoxide poisoning.\n\nCarbon monoxide has a molar mass of 28.0, which, according to the ideal gas law, makes it slightly less dense than air, whose average molar mass is 28.8.\n\nThe bond length between the carbon atom and the oxygen atom is 112.8 pm. This bond length is consistent with a triple bond, as in molecular nitrogen (N), which has a similar bond length (109.76 pm) and nearly the same molecular mass. Carbon–oxygen double bonds are significantly longer, 120.8 pm in formaldehyde, for example. The boiling point (82 K) and melting point (68 K) are very similar to those of N (77 K and 63 K, respectively). The bond-dissociation energy of 1072 kJ/mol is stronger than that of N (942 kJ/mol) and represents the strongest chemical bond known.\n\nThe ground electronic state of carbon monoxide is a singlet state since there are no unpaired electrons.\n\nCarbon and oxygen together have a total of 10 electrons in the valence shell. Following the octet rule for both carbon and oxygen, the two atoms form a triple bond, with six shared electrons in three bonding molecular orbitals, rather than the usual double bond found in organic carbonyl compounds. Since four of the shared electrons come from the oxygen atom and only two from carbon, one bonding orbital is occupied by two electrons from oxygen, forming a dative or dipolar bond. This causes a C←O polarization of the molecule, with a small negative charge on carbon and a small positive charge on oxygen. The other two bonding orbitals are each occupied by one electron from carbon and one from oxygen, forming (polar) covalent bonds with a reverse C→O polarization, since oxygen is more electronegative than carbon. In the free carbon monoxide, a net negative charge δ remains at the carbon end and the molecule has a small dipole moment of 0.122 D.\n\nThe molecule is therefore asymmetric: oxygen has more electron density than carbon, and is also slightly positively charged compared to carbon being negative. By contrast, the isoelectronic dinitrogen molecule has no dipole moment.\n\nIf carbon monoxide acts as a ligand, the polarity of the dipole may reverse with a net negative charge on the oxygen end, depending on the structure of the coordination complex.\nSee also the section \"\"Coordination chemistry\"\" below.\n\nTheoretical and experimental studies show that, despite the greater electronegativity of oxygen, the dipole moment points from the more-negative carbon end to the more-positive oxygen end. The three bonds are in fact polar covalent bonds that are strongly polarized. The calculated polarization toward the oxygen atom is 71% for the σ-bond and 77% for both π-bonds.\n\nThe oxidation state of carbon in carbon monoxide is +2 in each of these structures. It is calculated by counting all the bonding electrons as belonging to the more electronegative oxygen. Only the two non-bonding electrons on carbon are assigned to carbon. In this count, carbon then has only two valence electrons in the molecule compared to four in the free atom.\n\nCarbon monoxide poisoning is the most common type of fatal air poisoning in many countries. Carbon monoxide is colorless, odorless, and tasteless, but highly toxic. It combines with hemoglobin to produce carboxyhemoglobin, which usurps the space in hemoglobin that normally carries oxygen, but is ineffective for delivering oxygen to bodily tissues. Concentrations as low as 667 ppm may cause up to 50% of the body's hemoglobin to convert to carboxyhemoglobin. A level of 50% carboxyhemoglobin may result in seizure, coma, and fatality. In the United States, the OSHA limits long-term workplace exposure levels above 50 ppm.\n\nThe most common symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning may resemble other types of poisonings and infections, including symptoms such as headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, fatigue, and a feeling of weakness. Affected families often believe they are victims of food poisoning. Infants may be irritable and feed poorly. Neurological signs include confusion, disorientation, visual disturbance, syncope (fainting), and seizures.\n\nSome descriptions of carbon monoxide poisoning include retinal hemorrhages, and an abnormal cherry-red blood hue. In most clinical diagnoses these signs are seldom noticed. One difficulty with the usefulness of this cherry-red effect is that it corrects, or masks, what would otherwise be an unhealthy appearance, since the chief effect of removing deoxygenated hemoglobin is to make an asphyxiated person appear more normal, or a dead person appear more lifelike, similar to the effect of red colorants in embalming fluid. The \"false\" or unphysiologic red-coloring effect in anoxic CO-poisoned tissue is related to the meat-coloring commercial use of carbon monoxide, discussed below.\n\nCarbon monoxide also binds to other molecules such as myoglobin and mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase. Exposures to carbon monoxide may cause significant damage to the heart and central nervous system, especially to the globus pallidus, often with long-term chronic pathological conditions. Carbon monoxide may have severe adverse effects on the fetus of a pregnant woman.\n\nCarbon monoxide is produced naturally by the human body as a signaling molecule. Thus, carbon monoxide may have a physiological role in the body, such as a neurotransmitter or a blood vessel relaxant. Because of carbon monoxide's role in the body, abnormalities in its metabolism have been linked to a variety of diseases, including neurodegenerations, hypertension, heart failure, and pathological inflammation. Relative to inflammation, carbon monoxide has been shown to inhibit the movement of leukocytes to inflamed tissues, stimulate leukocyte phagocytosis of bacteria, and reduce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by leukocytes. In animal model studies, furthermore, carbon monoxide reduced the severity of experimentally induced bacterial sepsis, pancreatitis, hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury, colitis, osteoarthritis, lung injury, lung transplantation rejection, and neuropathic pain while promoting skin wound healing. These actions are similar to those of Specialized pro-resolving mediators which act to dampen, reverse, and repair the tissue damage due to diverse inflammation responses. Indeed, carbon monoxide can act additively with one of these mediators (Resolvin D1) to limit inflammatory responses. The studies implicate carbon monoxide as a physiological contributor to limiting inflammation and suggest that its delivery by inhalation or carbon monoxide-forming drugs may be therapeutically useful for controlling pathological inflammatory responses. \nCO functions as an endogenous signaling molecule, modulates functions of the cardiovascular system, inhibits blood platelet aggregation and adhesion, suppresses, reverses, and repairs the damage caused by inflammatory responses.\nIt may play a role as potential therapeutic agent.\n\nCarbon monoxide is a nutrient for methanogenic archaea, which reduce it to methane using hydrogen. This is the theme for the emerging field of bioorganometallic chemistry. Extremophile micro-organisms can, thus, utilize carbon monoxide in such locations as the thermal vents of volcanoes.\n\nSome microbes can convert carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide to yield energy.\n\nIn bacteria, carbon monoxide is produced via the reduction of carbon dioxide by the enzyme carbon monoxide dehydrogenase, an Fe-Ni-S-containing protein.\n\nCooA is a carbon monoxide sensor protein. The scope of its biological role is still unknown; it may be part of a signaling pathway in bacteria and archaea. Its occurrence in mammals is not established.\n\nCarbon monoxide occurs in various natural and artificial environments. Typical concentrations in parts per million are as follows:\n\nCarbon monoxide is present in small amounts in the atmosphere, chiefly as a product of volcanic activity but also from natural and man-made fires (such as forest and bushfires, burning of crop residues, and sugarcane fire-cleaning). The burning of fossil fuels also contributes to carbon monoxide production. Carbon monoxide occurs dissolved in molten volcanic rock at high pressures in the Earth's mantle. Because natural sources of carbon monoxide are so variable from year to year, it is extremely difficult to accurately measure natural emissions of the gas.\n\nCarbon monoxide is a short-lived greenhouse gas and also has an indirect radiative forcing effect by elevating concentrations of methane and tropospheric ozone through chemical reactions with other atmospheric constituents (e.g., the hydroxyl radical, OH) that would otherwise destroy them. Through natural processes in the atmosphere, it is eventually oxidized to carbon dioxide. Carbon monoxide is both short-lived in the atmosphere (on average about two months) and spatially variable in concentration.\n\nIn the atmosphere of Venus carbon monoxide occurs as a result of the photodissociation of carbon dioxide by electromagnetic radiation of wavelengths shorter than 169 nm.\n\nDue to its long lifetime in the mid-troposphere, carbon monoxide is also used as tracer of transport for pollutant plumes.\n\nCarbon monoxide is a temporary atmospheric pollutant in some urban areas, chiefly from the exhaust of internal combustion engines (including vehicles, portable and back-up generators, lawn mowers, power washers, etc.), but also from incomplete combustion of various other fuels (including wood, coal, charcoal, oil, paraffin, propane, natural gas, and trash).\n\nLarge CO pollution events can be observed from space over cities.\n\nCarbon monoxide is, along with aldehydes, part of the series of cycles of chemical reactions that form photochemical smog. It reacts with hydroxyl radical (OH) to produce a radical intermediate HOCO, which transfers rapidly its radical hydrogen to O to form peroxy radical (HO) and carbon dioxide (CO). Peroxy radical subsequently reacts with nitrogen oxide (NO) to form nitrogen dioxide (NO) and hydroxyl radical. NO gives O(P) via photolysis, thereby forming O following reaction with O.\nSince hydroxyl radical is formed during the formation of NO, the balance of the sequence of chemical reactions starting with carbon monoxide and leading to the formation of ozone is:\n\nAlthough the creation of NO is the critical step leading to low level ozone formation, it also increases this ozone in another, somewhat mutually exclusive way, by reducing the quantity of NO that is available to react with ozone.\n\nIn closed environments, the concentration of carbon monoxide can easily rise to lethal levels. On average, 170 people in the United States die every year from carbon monoxide produced by non-automotive consumer products. However, according to the Florida Department of Health, \"every year more than 500 Americans die from accidental exposure to carbon monoxide and thousands more across the U.S. require emergency medical care for non-fatal carbon monoxide poisoning\" These products include malfunctioning fuel-burning appliances such as furnaces, ranges, water heaters, and gas and kerosene room heaters; engine-powered equipment such as portable generators; fireplaces; and charcoal that is burned in homes and other enclosed areas. The American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC) reported 15,769 cases of carbon monoxide poisoning resulting in 39 deaths in 2007. In 2005, the CPSC reported 94 generator-related carbon monoxide poisoning deaths. Forty-seven of these deaths were known to have occurred during power outages due to severe weather, including Hurricane Katrina. Still others die from carbon monoxide produced by non-consumer products, such as cars left running in attached garages. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that several thousand people go to hospital emergency rooms every year to be treated for carbon monoxide poisoning.\n\nCarbon monoxide is absorbed through breathing and enters the blood stream through gas exchange in the lungs. It is also produced in heme catabolism and enters the blood from the tissues, and thus is present in all normal tissues, even if not inhaled.\n\nNormal circulating levels in the blood are 0% to 3%, are higher in smokers. Carbon monoxide levels cannot be assessed through a physical exam. Laboratory testing requires a blood sample (arterial or venous) and laboratory analysis on a CO-Oximeter. Additionally, a noninvasive carboxyhemoglobin (SpCO) test method from Pulse CO-Oximetry exists and has been validated compared to invasive methods.\n\nOutside of Earth, carbon monoxide is the second-most common molecule in the interstellar medium, after molecular hydrogen. Because of its asymmetry, the carbon monoxide molecule produces far brighter spectral lines than the hydrogen molecule, making CO much easier to detect. Interstellar CO was first detected with radio telescopes in 1970. It is now the most commonly used tracer of molecular gas in general in the interstellar medium of galaxies, as molecular hydrogen can only be detected using ultraviolet light, which requires space telescopes. Carbon monoxide observations provide much of the information about the molecular clouds in which most stars form.\n\nBeta Pictoris, the second brightest star in the constellation Pictor, shows an excess of infrared emission compared to normal stars of its type, which is caused by large quantities of dust and gas (including carbon monoxide) near the star.\n\nMany methods have been developed for carbon monoxide's production.\n\nA major industrial source of CO is producer gas, a mixture containing mostly carbon monoxide and nitrogen, formed by combustion of carbon in air at high temperature when there is an excess of carbon. In an oven, air is passed through a bed of coke. The initially produced CO equilibrates with the remaining hot carbon to give CO. The reaction of CO with carbon to give CO is described as the Boudouard reaction. Above 800 °C, CO is the predominant product:\n\nAnother source is \"water gas\", a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide produced via the endothermic reaction of steam and carbon:\n\nOther similar \"synthesis gases\" can be obtained from natural gas and other fuels.\n\nCarbon monoxide is also a byproduct of the reduction of metal oxide ores with carbon, shown in a simplified form as follows:\n\nCarbon monoxide is also produced by the direct oxidation of carbon in a limited supply of oxygen or air.\n\nSince CO is a gas, the reduction process can be driven by heating, exploiting the positive (favorable) entropy of reaction. The Ellingham diagram shows that CO formation is favored over CO in high temperatures.\n\nCarbon monoxide is conveniently produced in the laboratory by the dehydration of formic acid or oxalic acid, for example with concentrated sulfuric acid. Another method is heating an intimate mixture of powdered zinc metal and calcium carbonate, which releases CO and leaves behind zinc oxide and calcium oxide:\n\nSilver nitrate and iodoform also afford carbon monoxide:\n\nFinally, metal oxalate salts release CO upon heating, leaving a carbonate as byproduct:\n\nMost metals form coordination complexes containing covalently attached carbon monoxide. Only metals in lower oxidation states will complex with carbon monoxide ligands. This is because there must be sufficient electron density to facilitate back-donation from the metal d-orbital, to the π* molecular orbital from CO. The lone pair on the carbon atom in CO, also donates electron density to the d on the metal to form a sigma bond. This electron donation is also exhibited with the cis effect, or the labilization of CO ligands in the cis position. Nickel carbonyl, for example, forms by the direct combination of carbon monoxide and nickel metal:\nFor this reason, nickel in any tubing or part must not come into prolonged contact with carbon monoxide. Nickel carbonyl decomposes readily back to Ni and CO upon contact with hot surfaces, and this method is used for the industrial purification of nickel in the Mond process.\n\nIn nickel carbonyl and other carbonyls, the electron pair on the carbon interacts with the metal; the carbon monoxide donates the electron pair to the metal. In these situations, carbon monoxide is called the carbonyl ligand. One of the most important metal carbonyls is iron pentacarbonyl, Fe(CO):\n\nMany metal-CO complexes are prepared by decarbonylation of organic solvents, not from CO. For instance, iridium trichloride and triphenylphosphine react in boiling 2-methoxyethanol or DMF to afford IrCl(CO)(PPh).\n\nMetal carbonyls in coordination chemistry are usually studied using infrared spectroscopy.\n\nIn the presence of strong acids and water, carbon monoxide reacts with alkenes to form carboxylic acids in a process known as the Koch–Haaf reaction. In the Gattermann–Koch reaction, arenes are converted to benzaldehyde derivatives in the presence of AlCl and HCl. Organolithium compounds (e.g. butyl lithium) react with carbon monoxide, but these reactions have little scientific use.\n\nAlthough CO reacts with carbocations and carbanions, it is relatively nonreactive toward organic compounds without the intervention of metal catalysts.\n\nWith main group reagents, CO undergoes several noteworthy reactions. Chlorination of CO is the industrial route to the important compound phosgene. With borane CO forms the adduct HBCO, which is isoelectronic with the acetylium cation [HCCO]. CO reacts with sodium to give products resulting from C-C coupling such as sodium acetylenediolate 2·. It reacts with molten potassium to give a mixture of an organometallic compound, potassium acetylenediolate 2·, potassium benzenehexolate 6 , and potassium rhodizonate 2·.\n\nThe compounds cyclohexanehexone or triquinoyl (CO) and cyclopentanepentone or leuconic acid (CO), which so far have been obtained only in trace amounts, can be regarded as polymers of carbon monoxide.\n\nAt pressures of over 5 gigapascals, carbon monoxide converts into a solid polymer of carbon and oxygen. This is metastable at atmospheric pressure but is a powerful explosive.\n\nCarbon monoxide is an industrial gas that has many applications in bulk chemicals manufacturing. Large quantities of aldehydes are produced by the hydroformylation reaction of alkenes, carbon monoxide, and H. Hydroformylation is coupled to the Shell higher olefin process to give precursors to detergents.\n\nPhosgene, useful for preparing isocyanates, polycarbonates, and polyurethanes, is produced by passing purified carbon monoxide and chlorine gas through a bed of porous activated carbon, which serves as a catalyst. World production of this compound was estimated to be 2.74 million tonnes in 1989.\nMethanol is produced by the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide. In a related reaction, the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide is coupled to C-C bond formation, as in the Fischer-Tropsch process where carbon monoxide is hydrogenated to liquid hydrocarbon fuels. This technology allows coal or biomass to be converted to diesel.\n\nIn the Monsanto process, carbon monoxide and methanol react in the presence of a homogeneous rhodium catalyst and hydroiodic acid to give acetic acid. This process is responsible for most of the industrial production of acetic acid.\n\nAn industrial scale use for pure carbon monoxide is purifying nickel in the Mond process.\n\nCarbon monoxide is used in modified atmosphere packaging systems in the US, mainly with fresh meat products such as beef, pork, and fish to keep them looking fresh. The carbon monoxide combines with myoglobin to form carboxymyoglobin, a bright-cherry-red pigment. Carboxymyoglobin is more stable than the oxygenated form of myoglobin, oxymyoglobin, which can become oxidized to the brown pigment metmyoglobin. This stable red color can persist much longer than in normally packaged meat. Typical levels of carbon monoxide used in the facilities that use this process are between 0.4% to 0.5%.\n\nThe technology was first given \"generally recognized as safe\" (GRAS) status by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2002 for use as a secondary packaging system, and does not require labeling. In 2004, the FDA approved CO as primary packaging method, declaring that CO does not mask spoilage odor. Despite this ruling, the process remains controversial for fears that it masks spoilage. In 2007, a bill was introduced to the United States House of Representatives to label modified atmosphere carbon monoxide packaging as a color additive, but the bill died in subcommittee. The process is banned in many other countries, including Japan, Singapore, and the European Union.\n\nIn biology, carbon monoxide is naturally produced by the action of heme oxygenase 1 and 2 on the heme from hemoglobin breakdown. This process produces a certain amount of carboxyhemoglobin in normal persons, even if they do not breathe any carbon monoxide.\n\nFollowing the first report that carbon monoxide is a normal neurotransmitter in 1993, as well as one of three gases that naturally modulate inflammatory responses in the body (the other two being nitric oxide and hydrogen sulfide), carbon monoxide has received a great deal of clinical attention as a biological regulator. In many tissues, all three gases are known to act as anti-inflammatories, vasodilators, and encouragers of neovascular growth. However, the issues are complex, as neovascular growth is not always beneficial, since it plays a role in tumor growth, and also the damage from \"wet\" macular degeneration, a disease for which smoking (a major source of carbon monoxide in the blood, several times more than natural production) increases the risk from 4 to 6 times.\n\nThere is a theory that, in some nerve cell synapses, when long-term memories are being laid down, the receiving cell makes carbon monoxide, which back-transmits to the transmitting cell, telling it to transmit more readily in future. Some such nerve cells have been shown to contain guanylate cyclase, an enzyme that is activated by carbon monoxide.\n\nStudies involving carbon monoxide have been conducted in many laboratories throughout the world for its anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective properties. These properties have potential to be used to prevent the development of a series of pathological conditions including ischemia reperfusion injury, transplant rejection, atherosclerosis, severe sepsis, severe malaria, or autoimmunity. Clinical tests involving humans have been performed, however the results have not yet been released.\n\nCarbon monoxide is a strong reductive agent, and whilst not known, it has been used in pyrometallurgy to reduce metals from ores since ancient times. Carbon monoxide strips oxygen off metal oxides, reducing them to pure metal in high temperatures, forming carbon dioxide in the process. Carbon monoxide is not usually supplied as is, in gaseous phase, in the reactor, but rather it is formed in high temperature in presence of oxygen-carrying ore, carboniferous agent such as coke and high temperature. The blast furnace process is a typical example of a process of reduction of metal from ore with carbon monoxide.\n\nCarbon monoxide has also been used as a lasing medium in high-powered infrared lasers.\n\nCarbon monoxide has been proposed for use as a fuel on Mars. Carbon monoxide/oxygen engines have been suggested for early surface transportation use as both carbon monoxide and oxygen can be straightforwardly produced from the atmosphere of Mars by zirconia electrolysis, without using any Martian water resources to obtain hydrogen, which would be needed to make methane or any hydrogen-based fuel. Likewise, blast furnace gas collected at the top of blast furnace, still contains some 10% to 30% of carbon monoxide, and is used as fuel on Cowper stoves and on Siemens-Martin furnaces on open hearth steelmaking.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6138", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6138", "title": "Conjecture", "text": "Conjecture\n\nIn mathematics, a conjecture is a conclusion or proposition based on incomplete information, for which no proof has been found. Conjectures such as the Riemann hypothesis (still a conjecture) or Fermat's Last Theorem (which was a conjecture until proven in 1995) have shaped much of mathematical history as new areas of mathematics are developed in order to prove them.\n\nIn number theory, Fermat's Last Theorem (sometimes called Fermat's conjecture, especially in older texts) states that no three positive integers \"a\", \"b\", and \"c\" can satisfy the equation \"a\" + \"b\" = \"c\" for any integer value of \"n\" greater than two.\n\nThis theorem was first conjectured by Pierre de Fermat in 1637 in the margin of a copy of \"Arithmetica\" where he claimed he had a proof that was too large to fit in the margin. The first successful proof was released in 1994 by Andrew Wiles, and formally published in 1995, after 358 years of effort by mathematicians. The unsolved problem stimulated the development of algebraic number theory in the 19th century and the proof of the modularity theorem in the 20th century. It is among the most notable theorems in the history of mathematics and prior to its proof it was in the \"Guinness Book of World Records\" for \"most difficult mathematical problems\".\n\nIn mathematics, the four color theorem, or the four color map theorem, states that, given any separation of a plane into contiguous regions, producing a figure called a \"map\", no more than four colors are required to color the regions of the map so that no two adjacent regions have the same color. Two regions are called \"adjacent\" if they share a common boundary that is not a corner, where corners are the points shared by three or more regions. For example, in the map of the United States of America, Utah and Arizona are adjacent, but Utah and New Mexico, which only share a point that also belongs to Arizona and Colorado, are not.\n\nMöbius mentioned the problem in his lectures as early as 1840. The conjecture was first proposed on October 23, 1852 when Francis Guthrie, while trying to color the map of counties of England, noticed that only four different colors were needed. The five color theorem, which has a short elementary proof, states that five colors suffice to color a map and was proven in the late 19th century ; however, proving that four colors suffice turned out to be significantly harder. A number of false proofs and false counterexamples have appeared since the first statement of the four color theorem in 1852.\n\nThe four color theorem was proven in 1976 by Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken. It was the first major theorem to be proved using a computer. Appel and Haken's approach started by showing that there is a particular set of 1,936 maps, each of which cannot be part of a smallest-sized counterexample to the four color theorem. (If they did appear, you could make a smaller counter-example.) Appel and Haken used a special-purpose computer program to confirm that each of these maps had this property. Additionally, any map that could potentially be a counterexample must have a portion that looks like one of these 1,936 maps. Showing this required hundreds of pages of hand analysis, Appel and Haken concluded that no smallest counterexamples exists because any must contain, yet do not contain, one of these 1,936 maps. This contradiction means there are no counterexamples at all and that the theorem is therefore true. Initially, their proof was not accepted by all mathematicians because the computer-assisted proof was infeasible for a human to check by hand . Since then the proof has gained wider acceptance, although doubts remain .\n\nThe Hauptvermutung (German for main conjecture) of geometric topology is the conjecture that any two triangulations of a triangulable space have a common refinement, a single triangulation that is a subdivision of both of them. It was originally formulated in 1908, by Steinitz and Tietze.\n\nThis conjecture is now known to be false. The non-manifold version was disproved by John Milnor in 1961 using Reidemeister torsion.\n\nThe manifold version is true in dimensions . The cases were proved by Tibor Radó and Edwin E. Moise in the 1920s and 1950s, respectively.\n\nIn mathematics, the Weil conjectures were some highly influential proposals by on the generating functions (known as local zeta-functions) derived from counting the number of points on algebraic varieties over finite fields.\n\nA variety \"V\" over a finite field with \"q\" elements has a finite number of rational points, as well as points over every finite field with \"q\" elements containing that field. The generating function has coefficients derived from the numbers \"N\" of points over the (essentially unique) field with \"q\" elements.\n\nWeil conjectured that such \"zeta-functions\" should be rational functions, should satisfy a form of functional equation, and should have their zeroes in restricted places. The last two parts were quite consciously modeled on the Riemann zeta function and Riemann hypothesis. The rationality was proved by , the functional equation by , and the analogue of the Riemann hypothesis was proved by \n\nIn mathematics, the Poincaré conjecture is a theorem about the characterization of the 3-sphere, which is the hypersphere that bounds the unit ball in four-dimensional space. The conjecture states: An equivalent form of the conjecture involves a coarser form of equivalence than homeomorphism called homotopy equivalence: if a 3-manifold is \"homotopy equivalent\" to the 3-sphere, then it is necessarily \"homeomorphic\" to it.\n\nOriginally conjectured by Henri Poincaré, the theorem concerns a space that locally looks like ordinary three-dimensional space but is connected, finite in size, and lacks any boundary (a closed 3-manifold). The Poincaré conjecture claims that if such a space has the additional property that each loop in the space can be continuously tightened to a point, then it is necessarily a three-dimensional sphere. An analogous result has been known in higher dimensions for some time.\n\nAfter nearly a century of effort by mathematicians, Grigori Perelman presented a proof of the conjecture in three papers made available in 2002 and 2003 on arXiv. The proof followed on from the program of Richard S. Hamilton to use the Ricci flow to attempt to solve the problem. Hamilton later introduced a modification of the standard Ricci flow, called \"Ricci flow with surgery\" to systematically excise singular regions as they develop, in a controlled way, but was unable to prove this method \"converged\" in three dimensions. Perelman completed this portion of the proof. Several teams of mathematicians have verified that Perelman's proof is correct.\n\nThe Poincaré conjecture, before being proven, was one of the most important open questions in topology.\n\nIn mathematics, the Riemann hypothesis, proposed by , is a conjecture that the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function all have real part 1/2. The name is also used for some closely related analogues, such as the Riemann hypothesis for curves over finite fields.\n\nThe Riemann hypothesis implies results about the distribution of prime numbers. Along with suitable generalizations, some mathematicians consider it the most important unresolved problem in pure mathematics . The Riemann hypothesis, along with the Goldbach conjecture, is part of Hilbert's eighth problem in David Hilbert's list of 23 unsolved problems; it is also one of the Clay Mathematics Institute Millennium Prize Problems.\n\nThe P versus NP problem is a major unsolved problem in computer science. Informally, it asks whether every problem whose solution can be quickly verified by a computer can also be quickly solved by a computer; it is widely conjectured that the answer is no. It was essentially first mentioned in a 1956 letter written by Kurt Gödel to John von Neumann. Gödel asked whether a certain NP complete problem could be solved in quadratic or linear time. The precise statement of the P=NP problem was introduced in 1971 by Stephen Cook in his seminal paper \"The complexity of theorem proving procedures\" and is considered by many to be the most important open problem in the field. It is one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems selected by the Clay Mathematics Institute to carry a US$1,000,000 prize for the first correct solution.\n\n\nFormal mathematics is based on \"provable\" truth. In mathematics, any number of cases supporting a conjecture, no matter how large, is insufficient for establishing the conjecture's veracity, since a single counterexample would immediately bring down the conjecture. Mathematical journals sometimes publish the minor results of research teams having extended the search for a counterexample farther than previously done. For instance, the Collatz conjecture, which concerns whether or not certain sequences of integers terminate, has been tested for all integers up to 1.2 × 10 (over a trillion). However, the failure to find a counterexample after extensive search does not constitute a proof that no counterexample exists nor that the conjecture is true, because the conjecture might be false but with a very large minimal counterexample.\n\nInstead, a conjecture is considered proven only when it has been shown that it is logically impossible for it to be false. There are various methods of doing so; see Mathematical proof#Methods for details.\n\nOne method of proof, usable when there are only a finite number of cases that could lead to counterexamples, is known as \"brute force\": in this approach, all possible cases are considered and shown not to give counterexamples. Sometimes the number of cases is quite large, in which situation a brute-force proof may require as a practical matter the use of a computer algorithm to check all the cases: the validity of the 1976 and 1997 brute-force proofs of the four color theorem by computer was initially doubted, but was eventually confirmed in 2005 by theorem-proving software.\n\nWhen a conjecture has been proven, it is no longer a conjecture but a theorem. Many important theorems were once conjectures, such as the Geometrization theorem (which resolved the Poincaré conjecture), Fermat's Last Theorem, and others.\n\nConjectures disproven through counterexample are sometimes referred to as \"false conjectures\" (cf. the Pólya conjecture and Euler's sum of powers conjecture). In the case of the latter, the first counterexample found for the n=4 case involved numbers in the millions, although subsequently it has been found that the minimal counterexample is smaller than that.\n\nNot every conjecture ends up being proven true or false. The continuum hypothesis, which tries to ascertain the relative cardinality of certain infinite sets, was eventually shown to be undecidable (or independent) from the generally accepted set of axioms of set theory. It is therefore possible to adopt this statement, or its negation, as a new axiom in a consistent manner (much as we can take Euclid's parallel postulate as either true or false).\n\nIn this case, if a proof uses this statement, researchers will often look for a new proof that \"doesn't\" require the hypothesis (in the same way that it is desirable that statements in Euclidean geometry be proved using only the axioms of neutral geometry, i.e. no parallel postulate.) The one major exception to this in practice is the axiom of choice—unless studying this axiom in particular, the majority of researchers do not usually worry whether a result requires the axiom of choice.\n\nSometimes a conjecture is called a \"hypothesis\" when it is used frequently and repeatedly as an assumption in proofs of other results. For example, the Riemann hypothesis is a conjecture from number theory that (amongst other things) makes predictions about the distribution of prime numbers. Few number theorists doubt that the Riemann hypothesis is true. In anticipation of its eventual proof, some have proceeded to develop further proofs which are contingent on the truth of this conjecture. These are called \"conditional proofs\": the conjectures assumed appear in the hypotheses of the theorem, for the time being.\n\nThese \"proofs\", however, would fall apart if it turned out that the hypothesis was false, so there is considerable interest in verifying the truth or falsity of conjectures of this type.\n\nKarl Popper pioneered the use of the term \"conjecture\" in scientific philosophy. Conjecture is related to hypothesis, which in science refers to a testable conjecture.\n\n\n"}

A member of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, he was the son of Drusus and Antonia Minor. He was born at Lugdunum in Gaul, the first (and until Trajan, the only) Roman Emperor to be born outside Italy. Because he was afflicted with a limp and slight deafness due to sickness at a young age, his family ostracized him and excluded him from public office until his consulship, shared with his nephew Caligula in 37.\n\nClaudius' infirmity probably saved him from the fate of many other nobles during the purges of Tiberius and Caligula's reigns; potential enemies did not see him as a serious threat. His survival led to his being declared Emperor by the Praetorian Guard after Caligula's assassination, at which point he was the last man of his family.\n\nDespite his lack of experience, Claudius proved to be an able and efficient administrator. He was also an ambitious builder, constructing many new roads, aqueducts, and canals across the Empire. During his reign the Empire began the conquest of Britain (if the earlier invasions of Britain by Caesar and Caligula's aborted attempts are not counted). Having a personal interest in law, he presided at public trials, and issued up to twenty edicts a day. He was seen as vulnerable throughout his reign, particularly by elements of the nobility. Claudius was constantly forced to shore up his position; this resulted in the deaths of many senators. These events damaged his reputation among the ancient writers, though more recent historians have revised this opinion. Many authors contend that he was murdered by his own wife. After his death in 54 AD (at age of 63), his grand-nephew and adopted son Nero succeeded him as Emperor.\n\nHe was a descendant of the Octavii Rufi (through Gaius Octavius), Julii Caesares (through Julia Minor and Julia Antonia), and the Claudii Nerones (through Nero Claudius Drusus); he was a great-nephew of Augustus through his full sister Octavia Minor, a nephew of Tiberius through his father Drusus, Tiberius' brother, an uncle of Caligula and finally a great-uncle of Nero through Caligula's father and Nero's grandfather Germanicus, his brother.\n\nClaudius was born on 1 August 10 BC at Lugdunum (modern Lyon, France). He had two older siblings, Germanicus and Livilla. His mother, Antonia, may have had two other children who died young.\n\nHis maternal grandparents were Mark Antony and Octavia Minor, Augustus' sister, and he was therefore the great-great grandnephew of Gaius Julius Caesar. His paternal grandparents were Livia, Augustus' third wife, and Tiberius Claudius Nero. During his reign, Claudius revived the rumor that his father Drusus was actually the illegitimate son of Augustus, to give the appearance that Augustus was Claudius' paternal grandfather.\n\nIn 9 BC, his father Drusus unexpectedly died on campaign in Germania, possibly from illness. Claudius was then left to be raised by his mother, who never remarried. When Claudius' disability became evident, the relationship with his family turned sour. Antonia referred to him as a monster, and used him as a standard for stupidity. She seems to have passed her son off on his grandmother Livia for a number of years.\n\nLivia was a little kinder, but nevertheless often sent him short, angry letters of reproof. He was put under the care of a \"former mule-driver\" to keep him disciplined, under the logic that his condition was due to laziness and a lack of will-power. However, by the time he reached his teenage years his symptoms apparently waned and his family took some notice of his scholarly interests.\n\nIn 7 AD, Livy was hired to tutor him in history, with the assistance of Sulpicius Flavus. He spent a lot of his time with the latter and the philosopher Athenodorus. Augustus, according to a letter, was surprised at the clarity of Claudius' oratory. Expectations about his future began to increase.\n\nHis work as a budding historian damaged his prospects for advancement in public life. According to Vincent Scramuzza and others, Claudius began work on a history of the Civil Wars that was either too truthful or too critical of Octavian—then reigning as Augustus Caesar. In either case, it was far too early for such an account, and may have only served to remind Augustus that Claudius was Antony's descendant. His mother and grandmother quickly put a stop to it, and this may have convinced them that Claudius was not fit for public office. He could not be trusted to toe the existing party line.\n\nWhen he returned to the narrative later in life, Claudius skipped over the wars of the second triumvirate altogether. But the damage was done, and his family pushed him into the background. When the Arch of Pavia was erected to honor the Imperial clan in 8 BC, Claudius' name (now Tiberius Claudius Nero Germanicus after his elevation to paterfamilias of Claudii Nerones on the adoption of his brother) was inscribed on the edge—past the deceased princes, Gaius and Lucius, and Germanicus' children. There is some speculation that the inscription was added by Claudius himself decades later, and that he originally did not appear at all.\n\nWhen Augustus died in 14 AD, Claudius — then 23 — appealed to his uncle Tiberius to allow him to begin the \"cursus honorum\". Tiberius, the new Emperor, responded by granting Claudius consular ornaments. Claudius requested office once more and was snubbed. Since the new Emperor was no more generous than the old, Claudius gave up hope of public office and retired to a scholarly, private life.\n\nDespite the disdain of the Imperial family, it seems that from very early on the general public respected Claudius. At Augustus' death, the \"equites\", or knights, chose Claudius to head their delegation. When his house burned down, the Senate demanded it be rebuilt at public expense. They also requested that Claudius be allowed to debate in the Senate. Tiberius turned down both motions, but the sentiment remained.\n\nDuring the period immediately after the death of Tiberius' son, Drusus, Claudius was pushed by some quarters as a potential heir. This again suggests the political nature of his exclusion from public life. However, as this was also the period during which the power and terror of the commander of the Praetorian Guard, Sejanus, was at its peak, Claudius chose to downplay this possibility.\n\nAfter the death of Tiberius the new emperor Caligula (the son of Claudius' brother Germanicus) recognized Claudius to be of some use. He appointed Claudius his co-consul in 37 in order to emphasize the memory of Caligula's deceased father Germanicus. Despite this, Caligula relentlessly tormented his uncle: playing practical jokes, charging him enormous sums of money, humiliating him before the Senate, and the like. According to Cassius Dio Claudius became very sickly and thin by the end of Caligula's reign, most likely due to stress. A possible surviving portrait of Claudius from this period may support this.\n\nOn 24 January 41, Caligula was assassinated in a broad-based conspiracy involving the Praetorian commander Cassius Chaerea and several senators. There is no evidence that Claudius had a direct hand in the assassination, although it has been argued that he knew about the plot — particularly since he left the scene of the crime shortly before his nephew was murdered. However, after the deaths of Caligula's wife and daughter, it became apparent that Cassius intended to go beyond the terms of the conspiracy and wipe out the Imperial family.\nIn the chaos following the murder, Claudius witnessed the German guard cut down several uninvolved noblemen, including many of his friends. He fled to the palace to hide. According to tradition, a Praetorian named Gratus found him hiding behind a curtain and suddenly declared him \"princeps\". A section of the guard may have planned in advance to seek out Claudius, perhaps with his approval. They reassured him that they were not one of the battalions looking for revenge. He was spirited away to the Praetorian camp and put under their protection.\n\nThe Senate quickly met and began debating a change of government, but this eventually devolved into an argument over which of them would be the new \"princeps\". When they heard of the Praetorians' claim, they demanded that Claudius be delivered to them for approval, but he refused, sensing the danger that would come with complying. Some historians, particularly Josephus, claim that Claudius was directed in his actions by the Judaean King Herod Agrippa. However, an earlier version of events by the same ancient author downplays Agrippa's role so it remains uncertain. Eventually the Senate was forced to give in and, in return, Claudius pardoned nearly all the assassins.\n\nClaudius took several steps to legitimize his rule against potential usurpers, most of them emphasizing his place within the Julio-Claudian family. He adopted the name \"Caesar\" as a cognomen, as the name still carried great weight with the populace. In order to do so, he dropped the cognomen \"Nero\" which he had adopted as \"paterfamilias\" of the Claudii Nerones when his brother Germanicus was adopted out.\n\nWhile Claudius had never been formally adopted either by Augustus or his successors, he was nevertheless the grandson of his sister Octavia, and so he felt that he had the right of family. He also adopted the name \"Augustus\" as the two previous emperors had done at their accessions. He kept the honorific \"Germanicus\" to display the connection with his heroic brother. He deified his paternal grandmother Livia to highlight her position as wife of the divine Augustus. Claudius frequently used the term \"filius Drusi\" (son of Drusus) in his titles, in order to remind the people of his legendary father and lay claim to his reputation.\n\nSince Claudius was the first Emperor proclaimed on the initiative of the Praetorian Guard instead of the Senate, his repute suffered at the hands of commentators (such as Seneca). Moreover, he was the first Emperor who resorted to bribery as a means to secure army loyalty and rewarded the soldiers of the Praetorian Guard that had elevated him with 15,000 sesterces. Tiberius and Augustus had both left gifts to the army and guard in their wills, and upon Caligula's death the same would have been expected, even if no will existed. Claudius remained grateful to the guard, however, issuing coins with tributes to the Praetorians in the early part of his reign.\n\nUnder Claudius, the Empire underwent its first major expansion since the reign of Augustus. The provinces of Thrace, Noricum, Pamphylia, Lycia, and Judea were annexed (or put under direct rule) under various circumstances during his term. The annexation of Mauretania, begun under Caligula, was completed after the defeat of rebel forces, and the official division of the former client kingdom into two Imperial provinces. The most far-reaching conquest was the conquest of Britannia\".\nIn 43 AD, Claudius sent Aulus Plautius with four legions to Britain (\"Britannia\") after an appeal from an ousted tribal ally. Britain was an attractive target for Rome because of its material wealth – particularly mines and slaves. It was also a haven for Gallic rebels and the like, and so could not be left alone much longer. Claudius himself travelled to the island after the completion of initial offensives, bringing with him reinforcements and elephants. The latter must have made an impression on the Britons when they were displayed in the large tribal centre of Camulodunum, modern day Colchester. The Roman \"colonia\" of \"Colonia Claudia Victricensis\" was established as the provincial capital of the newly established province of Britannia at Camulodunum, where a large Temple was dedicated in his honour.\n\nHe left after 16 days, but remained in the provinces for some time. The Senate granted him a triumph for his efforts. Only members of the Imperial family were allowed such honours, but Claudius subsequently lifted this restriction for some of his conquering generals. He was granted the honorific \"Britannicus\" but only accepted it on behalf of his son, never using the title himself. When the Briton general Caractacus was captured in 50 AD, Claudius granted him clemency. Caractacus lived out his days on land provided by the Roman state, an unusual end for an enemy commander.\n\nClaudius conducted a census in 48 that found 5,984,072 Roman citizens (adult males with Roman citizenship; women, children, slaves, and free adult males without Roman citizenship were not counted), an increase of around a million since the census conducted at Augustus' death. He had helped increase this number through the foundation of Roman colonies that were granted blanket citizenship. These colonies were often made out of existing communities, especially those with elites who could rally the populace to the Roman cause. Several colonies were placed in new provinces or on the border of the Empire to secure Roman holdings as quickly as possible.\n\nClaudius personally judged many of the legal cases tried during his reign. Ancient historians have many complaints about this, stating that his judgments were variable and sometimes did not follow the law. He was also easily swayed. Nevertheless, Claudius paid detailed attention to the operation of the judicial system.\n\nHe extended the summer court session, as well as the winter term, by shortening the traditional breaks. Claudius also made a law requiring plaintiffs to remain in the city while their cases were pending, as defendants had previously been required to do. These measures had the effect of clearing out the docket. The minimum age for jurors was also raised to 25 in order to ensure a more experienced jury pool.\n\nClaudius also settled disputes in the provinces. He freed the island of Rhodes from Roman rule for their good faith and exempted Troy from taxes. Early in his reign, the Greeks and Jews of Alexandria sent him two embassies at once after riots broke out between the two communities. This resulted in the famous \"Letter to the Alexandrians\", which reaffirmed Jewish rights in the city but also forbade them to move in more families en masse. According to Josephus, he then reaffirmed the rights and freedoms of all the Jews in the Empire.\n\nOne of Claudius's investigators discovered that many old Roman citizens based in the modern city of Trento were not in fact citizens. The Emperor issued a declaration, contained in the \"Tabula clesiana\", that they would be considered to hold citizenship from then on, since to strip them of their status would cause major problems. However, in individual cases, Claudius punished false assumption of citizenship harshly, making it a capital offense. Similarly, any freedmen found to be laying false claim to membership of the Roman equestrian order were sold back into slavery.\n\nNumerous edicts were issued throughout Claudius' reign. These were on a number of topics, everything from medical advice to moral judgments. A famous medical example is one promoting yew juice as a cure for snakebite. Suetonius wrote that he is even said to have thought of an edict allowing public flatulence for good health. One of the more famous edicts concerned the status of sick slaves. Masters had been abandoning ailing slaves at the temple of Aesculapius on Tiber Island to die instead of providing them with medical assistance and care, and then reclaiming them if they lived. Claudius ruled that slaves who were thus abandoned and recovered after such treatment would be free. Furthermore, masters who chose to kill slaves rather than take care of them were liable to be charged with murder.\n\nClaudius embarked on many public works throughout his reign, both in the capital and in the provinces. He built two aqueducts, the Aqua Claudia, begun by Caligula, and the Anio Novus. These entered the city in 52 AD and met at the famous Porta Maggiore. He also restored a third, the Aqua Virgo.\nHe paid special attention to transportation. Throughout Italy and the provinces he built roads and canals. Among these was a large canal leading from the Rhine to the sea, as well as a road from Italy to Germany – both begun by his father, Drusus. Closer to Rome, he built a navigable canal on the Tiber, leading to Portus, his new port just north of Ostia. This port was constructed in a semicircle with two moles and a lighthouse at its mouth. The construction also had the effect of reducing flooding in Rome.\n\nThe port at Ostia was part of Claudius' solution to the constant grain shortages that occurred in winter, after the Roman shipping season. The other part of his solution was to insure the ships of grain merchants who were willing to risk travelling to Egypt in the off-season. He also granted their sailors special privileges, including citizenship and exemption from the Lex Papia-Poppaea, a law that regulated marriage. In addition, he repealed the taxes that Caligula had instituted on food, and further reduced taxes on communities suffering drought or famine.\n\nThe last part of Claudius' plan was to increase the amount of arable land in Italy. This was to be achieved by draining the Fucine lake, which would have the added benefit of making the nearby river navigable year-round. A tunnel was dug through the lake bed, but the plan was a failure. The tunnel was crooked and not large enough to carry the water, which caused it to back up when opened. The resultant flood washed out a large gladiatorial exhibition held to commemorate the opening, causing Claudius to run for his life along with the other spectators. The draining of the lake was revisited many times in history, including by Emperors Trajan and Hadrian, and Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II in the Middle Ages. It was finally achieved by the Prince Torlonia in the 19th century, producing over of new arable land. He expanded the Claudian tunnel to three times its original size.\n\nBecause of the circumstances of his accession, Claudius took great pains to please the Senate. During regular sessions, the Emperor sat among the Senate body, speaking in turn. When introducing a law, he sat on a bench between the consuls in his position as holder of the power of Tribune (the Emperor could not officially serve as a Tribune of the Plebes as he was a Patrician, but it was a power taken by previous rulers). He refused to accept all his predecessors' titles (including Imperator) at the beginning of his reign, preferring to earn them in due course. He allowed the Senate to issue its own bronze coinage for the first time since Augustus. He also put the Imperial provinces of Macedonia and Achaea back under Senate control.\n\nClaudius set about remodeling the Senate into a more efficient, representative body. He chided the senators about their reluctance to debate bills introduced by himself, as noted in the fragments of a surviving speech:\n\nIn 47 he assumed the office of \"censor\" with Lucius Vitellius, which had been allowed to lapse for some time. He struck the names of many senators and equites who no longer met qualifications, but showed respect by allowing them to resign in advance. At the same time, he sought to admit eligible men from the provinces. The Lyon Tablet preserves his speech on the admittance of Gallic senators, in which he addresses the Senate with reverence but also with criticism for their disdain of these men. (He even jokes about how the Senate had admitted members from beyond Gallia Narbonensis (Lyons, France), i.e. himself). He also increased the number of Patricians by adding new families to the dwindling number of noble lines. Here he followed the precedent of Lucius Junius Brutus and Julius Caesar.\n\nNevertheless, many in the Senate remained hostile to Claudius, and many plots were made on his life. This hostility carried over into the historical accounts. As a result, Claudius reduced the Senate's power for the sake of efficiency. The administration of Ostia was turned over to an Imperial Procurator after construction of the port. Administration of many of the empire's financial concerns was turned over to Imperial appointees and freedmen. This led to further resentment and suggestions that these same freedmen were ruling the Emperor.\n\nSeveral coup attempts were made during Claudius' reign, resulting in the deaths of many senators. Appius Silanus was executed early in Claudius' reign under questionable circumstances. Shortly after, a large rebellion was undertaken by the Senator Vinicianus and Scribonianus, the governor of Dalmatia and gained quite a few senatorial supporters. It ultimately failed because of the reluctance of Scribonianus' troops, which led to the suicide of the main conspirators.\n\nMany other senators tried different conspiracies and were condemned. Claudius' son-in-law Pompeius Magnus was executed for his part in a conspiracy with his father Crassus Frugi. Another plot involved the consulars Lusiius Saturninus, Cornelius Lupus, and Pompeius Pedo.\n\nIn 46, Asinius Gallus, the grandson of Asinius Pollio, and Titus Statilius Taurus Corvinus were exiled for a plot hatched with several of Claudius' own freedmen. Valerius Asiaticus was executed without public trial for unknown reasons. The ancient sources say the charge was adultery, and that Claudius was tricked into issuing the punishment. However, Claudius singles out Asiaticus for special damnation in his speech on the Gauls, which dates over a year later, suggesting that the charge must have been much more serious.\n\nAsiaticus had been a claimant to the throne in the chaos following Caligula's death and a co-consul with the Titus Statilius Taurus Corvinus mentioned above. Most of these conspiracies took place before Claudius' term as Censor, and may have induced him to review the Senatorial rolls. The conspiracy of Gaius Silius in the year after his Censorship, 48, is detailed in the section discussing Claudius' third wife, Messalina. Suetonius states that a total of 35 senators and 300 knights were executed for offenses during Claudius' reign. Needless to say, the responses to these conspiracies could not have helped Senate-emperor relations.\n\nClaudius was hardly the first emperor to use freedmen to help with the day-to-day running of the Empire. He was, however, forced to increase their role as the powers of the \"princeps\" became more centralized and the burden larger. This was partly due to the ongoing hostility of the Senate, as mentioned above, but also due to his respect for the senators. Claudius did not want free-born magistrates to have to serve under him, as if they were not peers.\n\nThe secretariat was divided into bureaus, with each being placed under the leadership of one freedman. Narcissus was the secretary of correspondence. Pallas became the secretary of the treasury. Callistus became secretary of justice. There was a fourth bureau for miscellaneous issues, which was put under Polybius until his execution for treason. The freedmen could also officially speak for the Emperor, as when Narcissus addressed the troops in Claudius' stead before the conquest of Britain.\n\nSince these were important positions, the senators were aghast at their being placed in the hands of former slaves. If freedmen had total control of money, letters, and law, it seemed it would not be hard for them to manipulate the Emperor. This is exactly the accusation put forth by the ancient sources. However, these same sources admit that the freedmen were loyal to Claudius.\n\nHe was similarly appreciative of them and gave them due credit for policies where he had used their advice. However, if they showed treasonous inclinations, the Emperor did punish them with just force, as in the case of Polybius and Pallas' brother, Felix. There is no evidence that the character of Claudius' policies and edicts changed with the rise and fall of the various freedmen, suggesting that he was firmly in control throughout.\n\nRegardless of the extent of their political power, the freedmen did manage to amass wealth through their positions. Pliny the Elder notes that several of them were richer than Crassus, the richest man of the Republican era.\n\nClaudius, as the author of a treatise on Augustus' religious reforms, felt himself in a good position to institute some of his own. He had strong opinions about the proper form for state religion. He refused the request of Alexandrian Greeks to dedicate a temple to his divinity, saying that only gods may choose new gods. He restored lost days to festivals and got rid of many extraneous celebrations added by Caligula. He re-instituted old observances and archaic language.\n\nClaudius was concerned with the spread of eastern mysteries within the city and searched for more Roman replacements. He emphasized the Eleusinian mysteries which had been practiced by so many during the Republic. He expelled foreign astrologers, and at the same time rehabilitated the old Roman soothsayers (known as haruspices) as a replacement. He was especially hard on Druidism, because of its incompatibility with the Roman state religion and its proselytizing activities.\n\nIt is also reported that at one time he expelled the Jews from Rome, probably because the Jews within the city caused continuous disturbances at the instigation of Chrestus. Claudius opposed proselytizing in any religion, even in those regions where he allowed natives to worship freely. The results of all these efforts were recognized even by Seneca, who has an ancient Latin god defend Claudius in his satire.\n\nAccording to Suetonius, Claudius was extraordinarily fond of games. He is said to have risen with the crowd after gladiatorial matches and given unrestrained praise to the fighters. Claudius also presided over many new and original events. Soon after coming into power, Claudius instituted games to be held in honor of his father on the latter's birthday. Annual games were also held in honour of his accession, and took place at the Praetorian camp where Claudius had first been proclaimed Emperor.\n\nClaudius organised a performance of the Secular Games, marking the 800th anniversary of the founding of Rome. Augustus had performed the same games less than a century prior. Augustus' excuse was that the interval for the games was 110 years, not 100, but his date actually did not qualify under either reasoning. Claudius also presented naval battles to mark the attempted draining of the Fucine Lake, as well as many other public games and shows.\n\nAt Ostia, in front of a crowd of spectators, Claudius fought a killer whale which was trapped in the harbour. The event was witnessed by Pliny the Elder:\n\nClaudius also restored and adorned many public venues in Rome. At the Circus Maximus, the turning posts and starting stalls were replaced in marble and embellished, and an embankment was probably added to prevent flooding of the track. Claudius also reinforced or extended the seating rules that reserved front seating at the Circus for senators. Claudius rebuilt Pompey's Theatre after it had been destroyed by fire, organising special fights at the re-dedication which he observed from a special platform in the orchestra box.\n\nSuetonius and the other ancient authors accused Claudius of being dominated by women and wives, and of being a womanizer.\n\nClaudius married four times, after two failed betrothals. The first betrothal was to his distant cousin Aemilia Lepida, but was broken for political reasons. The second was to Livia Medullina, which ended with Medullina's sudden death on their wedding day.\n\nPlautia Urgulanilla was the granddaughter of Livia's confidant Urgulania. During their marriage she gave birth to a son, Claudius Drusus. Drusus died of asphyxiation in his early teens, shortly after becoming engaged to Junilla, the daughter of Sejanus.\n\nClaudius later divorced Urgulanilla for adultery and on suspicion of murdering her sister-in-law Apronia. When Urgulanilla gave birth after the divorce, Claudius repudiated the baby girl, Claudia, as the father was allegedly one of his own freedmen. This action made him later the target of criticism by his enemies.\n\nSoon after (possibly in 28), Claudius married Aelia Paetina, a relative of Sejanus, if not Sejanus's adoptive sister. During their marriage, Claudius and Paetina had a daughter, Claudia Antonia. He later divorced her after the marriage became a political liability, although Leon (1948) suggests it may have been due to emotional and mental abuse by Paetina.\n\nSome years after divorcing Aelia Paetina, in 38 or early 39, Claudius married Valeria Messalina, who was his first cousin once removed and closely allied with Caligula's circle. Shortly thereafter, she gave birth to a daughter, Claudia Octavia. A son, first named Tiberius Claudius Germanicus, and later known as Britannicus, was born just after Claudius' accession.\n\nThis marriage ended in tragedy. The ancient historians allege that Messalina was a nymphomaniac who was regularly unfaithful to Claudius — Tacitus states she went so far as to compete with a prostitute to see who could have the most sexual partners in a night — and manipulated his policies in order to amass wealth. In 48, Messalina married her lover Gaius Silius in a public ceremony while Claudius was at Ostia.\n\nSources disagree as to whether or not she divorced the Emperor first, and whether the intention was to usurp the throne. Scramuzza, in his biography, suggests that Silius may have convinced Messalina that Claudius was doomed, and the union was her only hope of retaining rank and protecting her children. The historian Tacitus suggests that Claudius's ongoing term as Censor may have prevented him from noticing the affair before it reached such a critical point. Whatever the case, the result was the execution of Silius, Messalina, and most of her circle.\n\nClaudius did marry once more. The ancient sources tell that his freedmen put forward three candidates, Caligula's third wife Lollia Paulina, Claudius's divorced second wife Aelia Paetina and Claudius's niece Agrippina the Younger. According to Suetonius, Agrippina won out through her feminine wiles.\n\nThe truth is probably more political. The attempted coup d'état by Silius and Messalina had probably made Claudius realize the weakness of his position as a member of the Claudian but not the Julian family. This weakness was compounded by the fact that he did not yet have an obvious adult heir, Britannicus being just a boy.\n\nAgrippina was one of the few remaining descendants of Augustus, and her son Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus (the future Emperor Nero) was one of the last males of the Imperial family. Coup attempts could rally around the pair and Agrippina was already showing such ambition. It has been suggested that the Senate may have pushed for the marriage, to end the feud between the Julian and Claudian branches. This feud dated back to Agrippina's mother's actions against Tiberius after the death of her husband Germanicus (Claudius's brother), actions which Tiberius had gladly punished. In any case, Claudius accepted Agrippina and later adopted the newly mature Nero as his son.\n\nNero was married to Claudius' daughter Octavia, made joint heir with the underage Britannicus, and promoted; Augustus had similarly named his grandson Postumus Agrippa and his stepson Tiberius as joint heirs, and Tiberius had named Caligula joint heir with his grandson Tiberius Gemellus. Adoption of adults or near adults was an old tradition in Rome, when a suitable natural adult heir was unavailable as was the case during Britannicus' minority. Claudius may have previously looked to adopt one of his sons-in-law to protect his own reign.\n\nFaustus Cornelius Sulla Felix, who was married to Claudius's daughter Claudia Antonia, was only descended from Octavia and Antony on one side – not close enough to the Imperial family to prevent doubts (although that did not stop others from making him the object of a coup attempt against Nero a few years later). Besides which, he was the half-brother of Valeria Messalina and at this time those wounds were still fresh. Nero was more popular with the general public as the grandson of Germanicus and the direct descendant of Augustus.\n\nThe historian Suetonius describes the physical manifestations of Claudius' affliction in relatively good detail. His knees were weak and gave way under him and his head shook. He stammered and his speech was confused. He slobbered and his nose ran when he was excited. The Stoic Seneca states in his \"Apocolocyntosis\" that Claudius' voice belonged to no land animal, and that his hands were weak as well.\n\nHowever, he showed no physical deformity, as Suetonius notes that when calm and seated he was a tall, well-built figure of \"dignitas\". When angered or stressed, his symptoms became worse. Historians agree that this condition improved upon his accession to the throne. Claudius himself claimed that he had exaggerated his ailments to save his life.\n\nModern assessments of his health have changed several times in the past century. Prior to World War II, infantile paralysis (or polio) was widely accepted as the cause. This is the diagnosis used in Robert Graves' Claudius novels, first published in the 1930s. Polio does not explain many of the described symptoms, however, and a more recent theory implicates cerebral palsy as the cause, as outlined by Ernestine Leon. Tourette syndrome has also been considered a possibility.\n\nAs a person, ancient historians described Claudius as generous and lowbrow, a man who sometimes lunched with the plebeians. They also paint him as bloodthirsty and cruel, overly fond of gladiatorial combat and executions, and very quick to anger; Claudius himself acknowledged the latter trait, and apologized publicly for his temper. According to the ancient historians he was also overly trusting, and easily manipulated by his wives and freedmen. But at the same time they portray him as paranoid and apathetic, dull and easily confused.\n\nThe extant works of Claudius present a different view, painting a picture of an intelligent, scholarly, well-read, and conscientious administrator with an eye to detail and justice. Thus, Claudius becomes an enigma. Since the discovery of his \"Letter to the Alexandrians\" in the last century, much work has been done to rehabilitate Claudius and determine where the truth lies.\n\nClaudius wrote copiously throughout his life. Arnaldo Momigliano states that during the reign of Tiberius – which covers the peak of Claudius' literary career – it became impolitic to speak of republican Rome. The trend among the young historians was to either write about the new empire or obscure antiquarian subjects. Claudius was the rare scholar who covered both.\n\nBesides the history of Augustus' reign that caused him so much grief, his major works included \"Tyrrhenica\", a twenty book Etruscan history, and \"Carchedonica\", an eight volume history of Carthage, as well as an Etruscan dictionary. He also wrote a book on dice playing. Despite the general avoidance of the Republican era, he penned a defense of Cicero against the charges of Asinius Gallus. Modern historians have used this to determine the nature of his politics and of the aborted chapters of his civil war history.\nHe proposed a reform of the Latin alphabet by the addition of three new letters, two of which served the function of the modern letters \"W\" and \"Y\". He officially instituted the change during his censorship but they did not survive his reign. Claudius also tried to revive the old custom of putting dots between successive words (Classical Latin was written with no spacing). Finally, he wrote an eight-volume autobiography, that Suetonius describes as lacking in taste. Since Claudius (like most of the members of his dynasty) harshly criticized his predecessors and relatives in surviving speeches, it is not hard to imagine the nature of Suetonius' charge.\n\nNone of the works survive but live on as sources for the surviving histories of the Julio-Claudian dynasty. Suetonius quotes Claudius' autobiography once and must have used it as a source numerous times. Tacitus uses Claudius' arguments for the orthographical innovations mentioned above and may have used him for some of the more antiquarian passages in his annals. Claudius is the source for numerous passages of Pliny's \"Natural History\".\n\nThe influence of historical study on Claudius is obvious. In his speech on Gallic senators, he uses a version of the founding of Rome identical to that of Livy, his tutor in adolescence. The speech is meticulous in details, a common mark of all his extant works, and he goes into long digressions on related matters. This indicates a deep knowledge of a variety of historical subjects that he could not help but share. Many of the public works instituted in his reign were based on plans first suggested by Julius Caesar. Levick believes this emulation of Caesar may have spread to all aspects of his policies.\n\nHis censorship seems to have been based on those of his ancestors, particularly Appius Claudius Caecus, and he used the office to put into place many policies based on those of Republican times. This is when many of his religious reforms took effect, and his building efforts greatly increased during his tenure. In fact, his assumption of the office of Censor may have been motivated by a desire to see his academic labors bear fruit. For example, he believed (as most Romans did) that his ancestor Appius Claudius Caecus had used the censorship to introduce the letter \"R\" and so used his own term to introduce his new letters.\n\nThe consensus of ancient historians was that Claudius was murdered by poison – possibly contained in mushrooms or on a feather – and died in the early hours of 13 October 54 AD.\n\nNearly all implicate his final wife, Agrippina, as the instigator. Agrippina and Claudius had become more combative in the months leading up to his death. This carried on to the point where Claudius openly lamented his bad wives, and began to comment on Britannicus' approaching manhood with an eye towards restoring his status within the imperial family. Agrippina had motive in ensuring the succession of Nero before Britannicus could gain power.\n\nSome implicate either his taster Halotus, his doctor Xenophon, or the infamous poisoner Locusta as the administrator of the fatal substance. Some say he died after prolonged suffering following a single dose at dinner, and some have him recovering only to be poisoned again. Among contemporary sources, Seneca the younger ascribed the emperor's death to natural causes, while Josephus only spoke of rumors on his poisoning.\n\nIn modern times, some authors have cast doubt on whether Claudius was murdered or merely succumbed to illness or old age. Some modern scholars claim the near universality of the accusations in ancient texts lends credence to the crime. Claudius' ashes were interred in the Mausoleum of Augustus on 24 October 54 AD, after a funeral in the manner of Augustus.\n\nAlready, while alive, he received the widespread private worship of a living Princeps and was worshipped in Britannia in his own temple in Camulodunum.\n\nClaudius was deified by Nero and the Senate almost immediately. Those who regard this homage as cynical should note that, cynical or not, such a move would hardly have benefited those involved, had Claudius been \"hated\", as some commentators, both modern and historic, characterize him. Many of Claudius' less solid supporters quickly became Nero's men. Claudius' will had been changed shortly before his death to either recommend Nero and Britannicus jointly or perhaps just Britannicus, who would have been considered an adult man according to Roman law only a few months later.\n\nAgrippina had sent away Narcissus shortly before Claudius' death, and now murdered the freedman. The last act of this secretary of letters was to burn all of Claudius' correspondence — most likely so it could not be used against him and others in an already hostile new regime. Thus Claudius' private words about his own policies and motives were lost to history. Just as Claudius had criticized his predecessors in official edicts (see below), Nero often criticized the deceased Emperor and many of Claudius' laws and edicts were disregarded under the reasoning that he was too stupid and senile to have meant them.\n\nSeneca's Apocolocyntosis reinforces the view of Claudius as an unpleasant fool and this remained the official view for the duration of Nero's reign. Eventually Nero stopped referring to his deified adoptive father at all, and realigned with his birth family. Claudius' temple was left unfinished after only some of the foundation had been laid down. Eventually the site was overtaken by Nero's Golden House.\n\nThe Flavians, who had risen to prominence under Claudius, took a different tack. They were in a position where they needed to shore up their legitimacy, but also justify the fall of the Julio-Claudians. They reached back to Claudius in contrast with Nero, to show that they were good associated with good. Commemorative coins were issued of Claudius and his son Britannicus, who had been a friend of the Emperor Titus (Titus was born in 39, Britannicus was born in 41). When Nero's Golden House was burned, the Temple of Claudius was finally completed on the Caelian Hill.\n\nHowever, as the Flavians became established, they needed to emphasize their own credentials more, and their references to Claudius ceased. Instead, he was lumped with the other emperors of the fallen dynasty. His state cult in Rome probably continued until the abolition of all such cults of dead Emperors by Maximinus Thrax in 237–238. The \"Feriale Duranum\", probably identical to the festival calendars of every regular army unit, assigns him a sacrifice of a steer on his birthday, the Kalends of August. And such commemoration (and consequent feasting) probably continued until the Christianization and disintegration of the army in the late 4th century.\n\nThe main ancient historians Tacitus, Suetonius, and Cassius Dio all wrote after the last of the Flavians had gone. All three were senators or \"equites\". They took the side of the Senate in most conflicts with the Princeps, invariably viewing him as being in the wrong. This resulted in biases, both conscious and unconscious. Suetonius lost access to the official archives shortly after beginning his work. He was forced to rely on second-hand accounts when it came to Claudius (with the exception of Augustus' letters, which had been gathered earlier). Suetonius painted Claudius as a ridiculous figure, belittling many of his acts and attributing the objectively good works to his retinue.\n\nTacitus wrote a narrative for his fellow senators and fitted each of the emperors into a simple mold of his choosing. He wrote of Claudius as a passive pawn and an idiot in affairs relating to the palace and often in public life. During his censorship of 47-8 Tacitus allows the reader a glimpse of a Claudius who is more statesmanlike (XI.23-25), but it is a mere glimpse. Tacitus is usually held to have 'hidden' his use of Claudius' writings and to have omitted Claudius' character from his works. Even his version of Claudius' Lyons tablet speech is edited to be devoid of the Emperor's personality. Dio was less biased, but seems to have used Suetonius and Tacitus as sources. Thus the conception of Claudius as the weak fool, controlled by those he supposedly ruled, was preserved for the ages.\n\nAs time passed, Claudius was mostly forgotten outside of the historians' accounts. His books were lost first, as their antiquarian subjects became unfashionable. In the 2nd century, Pertinax, who shared his birthday, became emperor, overshadowing commemoration of Claudius.\n\n\nIn literature, Claudius and his contemporaries appear in the historical novel \"The Roman\" by Mika Waltari. Canadian-born science fiction writer A. E. van Vogt reimagined Robert Graves' Claudius story, in his two novels \"Empire of the Atom\" and \"The Wizard of Linn\".\n\n\n\n\n \n"}

{"id": "6172", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6172", "title": "Cantor set", "text": "Cantor set\n\nIn mathematics, the Cantor set is a set of points lying on a single line segment that has a number of remarkable and deep properties. It was discovered in 1874 by Henry John Stephen Smith and introduced by German mathematician Georg Cantor in 1883.\n\nThrough consideration of this set, Cantor and others helped lay the foundations of modern point-set topology. Although Cantor himself defined the set in a general, abstract way, the most common modern construction is the Cantor ternary set, built by removing the middle thirds of a line segment. Cantor himself mentioned the ternary construction only in passing, as an example of a more general idea, that of a perfect set that is nowhere dense.\n\nThe Cantor ternary set formula_1 is created by iteratively deleting the open middle third from a set of line segments. One starts by deleting the open middle third (, ) from the interval [0, 1], leaving two line segments: [0, ] ∪ [, 1]. Next, the open middle third of each of these remaining segments is deleted, leaving four line segments: [0, ] ∪ [, ] ∪ [, ] ∪ [, 1]. This process is continued ad infinitum, where the \"n\"th set is\n\nThe Cantor ternary set contains all points in the interval [0, 1] that are not deleted at any step in this infinite process:\n\nThe first six steps of this process are illustrated below.\n\nUsing the idea of self-similar transformations, formula_4 and formula_5 the explicit closed formulas for the Cantor set are\n\nor\n\nThis process of removing middle thirds is a simple example of a finite subdivision rule. The Cantor ternary set is an example of a fractal string.\n\nIn arithmetical terms, the Cantor set consists of all real numbers on the unit interval that are expressible as a ternary (base 3) fraction using only the digits 0 and 2. As the above diagram illustrates, each point in the Cantor set is uniquely located by a path through an infinitely deep binary tree, where the path turns left or right at each level according to which side of a deleted segment the point lies on. Representing each left turn with 0 and each right turn with 2 yields the ternary fraction for a point. It further follows that the Cantor set has a bijective mapping with the set of infinite binary sequences.\n\nSince the Cantor set is defined as the set of points not excluded, the proportion (i.e., measure) of the unit interval remaining can be found by total length removed. This total is the geometric progression\n\nSo that the proportion left is 1 – 1 = 0.\n\nThis calculation shows that the Cantor set cannot contain any interval of non-zero length. It may seem surprising that there should be anything left—after all, the sum of the lengths of the removed intervals is equal to the length of the original interval. However, a closer look at the process reveals that there must be something left, since removing the \"middle third\" of each interval involved removing open sets (sets that do not include their endpoints). So removing the line segment (/, /) from the original interval [0, 1] leaves behind the points / and /. Subsequent steps do not remove these (or other) endpoints, since the intervals removed are always internal to the intervals remaining. So the Cantor set is not empty, and in fact contains an uncountably infinite number of points (as follows from the above description in terms of paths in an infinite binary tree).\n\nIt may appear that \"only\" the endpoints of the construction segments are left, but that is not the case either. The number 1/4, for example, has the unique ternary form 0.020202…. It is in the bottom third, and the top ninth of that third, and the bottom twenty-seventh of that ninth, and so on. Since it is never in one of the middle segments, it is never removed. Yet it is also not an endpoint of any middle segment, because it is not a multiple of any power of 1/3.\nIn the sense of cardinality, \"most\" members of the Cantor set are not endpoints of deleted intervals. The construction steps, which are countable, each introduce a finite number of endpoints. Therefore the endpoints are also countable, while the whole Cantor set is not.\n\nIt can be shown that there are as many points left behind in this process as there were to begin with, and that therefore, the Cantor set is uncountable. To see this, we show that there is a function \"f\" from the Cantor set formula_1 to the closed interval [0,1] that is surjective (i.e. \"f\" maps from formula_1 onto [0,1]) so that the cardinality of formula_1 is no less than that of [0,1]. Since formula_1 is a subset of [0,1], its cardinality is also no greater, so the two cardinalities must in fact be equal, by the Cantor–Bernstein–Schroeder theorem.\n\nTo construct this function, consider the points in the [0, 1] interval in terms of base 3 (or ternary) notation. \nRecall that some points admit more than one representation in this notation, as for example /, that can be written as 0.1 but also as 0.022222..., and /, that can be written as 0.2 but also as 0.12222...\nWhen we remove the middle third, this contains the numbers with ternary numerals of the form 0.1xxxxx... where xxxxx... is strictly between 00000... and 22222... So the numbers remaining after the first step consist of\nThis can be summarized by saying that those numbers that admit a ternary representation such that the first digit after the decimal point is not 1 are the ones remaining after the first step.\n\nThe second step removes numbers of the form 0.01xxxx... and 0.21xxxx..., and (with appropriate care for the endpoints) it can be concluded that the remaining numbers are those with a ternary numeral where neither of the first \"two\" digits is 1. Continuing in this way, for a number not to be excluded at step \"n\", it must have a ternary representation whose \"n\"th digit is not 1. For a number to be in the Cantor set, it must not be excluded at any step, it must admit a numeral representation consisting entirely of 0s and 2s. It is worth emphasising that numbers like 1, / = 0.1 and / = 0.21 are in the Cantor set, as they have ternary numerals consisting entirely of 0s and 2s: 1 = 0.2222..., / = 0.022222... and / = 0.2022222... So while a number in formula_1 may have either a terminating or a recurring ternary numeral, one of its representations will consist entirely of 0s and 2s.\n\nThe function from formula_1 to [0,1] is defined by taking the numeral that does consist entirely of 0s and 2s, replacing all the 2s by 1s, and interpreting the sequence as a binary representation of a real number. In a formula,\n\nFor any number \"y\" in [0,1], its binary representation can be translated into a ternary representation of a number \"x\" in formula_1 by replacing all the 1s by 2s. With this, \"f\"(\"x\") = \"y\" so that \"y\" is in the range of \"f\". For instance if \"y\" = / = 0.100110011001..., we write \"x\" = 0.200220022002... = /. Consequently, \"f\" is surjective; however, \"f\" is \"not\" injective — interestingly enough, the values for which \"f\"(\"x\") coincides are those at opposing ends of one of the \"middle thirds\" removed. For instance, / = 0.2022222... and / = 0.2200000... so \"f\"(/) = 0.101111... = 0.11 = \"f\"(/).\n\nSo there are as many points in the Cantor set as there are in [0, 1], and the Cantor set is uncountable (see Cantor's diagonal argument). However, the set of endpoints of the removed intervals is countable, so there must be uncountably many numbers in the Cantor set which are not interval endpoints. As noted above, one example of such a number is ¼, which can be written as 0.02020202020... in ternary notation. In fact, given any formula_17, there exist formula_18 such that formula_19. This was first demonstrated by Steinhaus in 1917, who proved, via a geometric argument, the equivalent assertion that formula_20 for every formula_21. Since this construction provides an injection from formula_22 to formula_23, we have formula_24 as an immediate corollary. Assuming that formula_25 for any infinite set formula_26 (a statement shown to be equivalent to the axiom of choice by Tarski), this provides another demonstration that formula_27.\n\nThe Cantor set contains as many points as the interval from which it is taken, yet itself contains no interval of nonzero length. The irrational numbers have the same property, but the Cantor set has the additional property of being closed, so it is not even dense in any interval, unlike the irrational numbers which are dense in every interval.\n\nIt has been conjectured that all algebraic irrational numbers are normal. Since members of the Cantor set are not normal, this would imply that all members of the Cantor set are either rational or transcendental.\n\nThe Cantor set is the prototype of a fractal. It is self-similar, because it is equal to two copies of itself, if each copy is shrunk by a factor of 3 and translated. More precisely, there are two functions, the left and right self-similarity transformations, formula_28 and formula_29, which leave the Cantor set invariant up to homeomorphism: formula_30\n\nRepeated iteration of formula_31 and formula_32 can be visualized as an infinite binary tree. That is, at each node of the tree, one may consider the subtree to the left or to the right. Taking the set formula_33 together with function composition forms a monoid, the dyadic monoid.\n\nThe automorphisms of the binary tree are its hyperbolic rotations, and are given by the modular group. Thus, the Cantor set is a homogeneous space in the sense that for any two points formula_34 and formula_35 in the Cantor set formula_1, there exists a homeomorphism formula_37 with formula_38. These homeomorphisms can be expressed explicitly, as Möbius transformations. \n\nIt has been found that some form of conservation law is always responsible behind scaling and self-similarity. In the case of Cantor set it can be seen that the formula_39th moment (where formula_40 is the fractal dimension) of all the surviving intervals at any stage of the construction process is equal to constant which is equal to one in the case of Cantor set \n. We know that there are formula_41 intervals of size formula_42\npresent in the system at the formula_43th step of its construction. Then if we level the surviving intervals\nas formula_44 then the formula_39th moment is formula_46 since formula_47.\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor set is equal to ln(2)/ln(3) ≈ 0.631.\n\nAn essential property of Cantor sets is giving sufficiency of fractals for any given Hausdorff dimension formula_48:\n\nTheorem. For any given formula_49 there are uncountable fractals with Hausdorff dimension formula_48 in n-dimensional Euclidean space formula_51 \n\nAlthough \"the\" Cantor set typically refers to the original, middle-thirds Cantor described above, topologists often talk about \"a\" Cantor set, which means any topological space that is homeomorphic (topologically equivalent) to it.\n\nAs the above summation argument shows, the Cantor set is uncountable but has Lebesgue measure 0. Since the Cantor set is the complement of a union of open sets, it itself is a closed subset of the reals, and therefore a complete metric space. Since it is also totally bounded, the Heine–Borel theorem says that it must be compact.\n\nFor any point in the Cantor set and any arbitrarily small neighborhood of the point, there is some other number with a ternary numeral of only 0s and 2s, as well as numbers whose ternary numerals contain 1s. Hence, every point in the Cantor set is an accumulation point (also called a cluster point or limit point) of the Cantor set, but none is an interior point. A closed set in which every point is an accumulation point is also called a perfect set in topology, while a closed subset of the interval with no interior points is nowhere dense in the interval.\n\nEvery point of the Cantor set is also an accumulation point of the complement of the Cantor set.\n\nFor any two points in the Cantor set, there will be some ternary digit where they differ — one will have 0 and the other 2. By splitting the Cantor set into \"halves\" depending on the value of this digit, one obtains a partition of the Cantor set into two closed sets that separate the original two points. In the relative topology on the Cantor set, the points have been separated by a clopen set. Consequently, the Cantor set is totally disconnected. As a compact totally disconnected Hausdorff space, the Cantor set is an example of a Stone space.\n\nAs a topological space, the Cantor set is naturally homeomorphic to the product of countably many copies of the space formula_52, where each copy carries the discrete topology. This is the space of all sequences in two digits \n\nwhich can also be identified with the set of 2-adic integers. The basis for the open sets of the product topology are cylinder sets; the homeomorphism maps these to the subspace topology that the Cantor set inherits from the natural topology on the real number line. This characterization of the Cantor space as a product of compact spaces gives a second proof that Cantor space is compact, via Tychonoff's theorem.\n\nFrom the above characterization, the Cantor set is homeomorphic to the p-adic integers, and, if one point is removed from it, to the p-adic numbers.\n\nThe Cantor set is a subset of the reals, which are a metric space with respect to the ordinary distance metric; therefore the Cantor set itself is a metric space, by using that same metric. Alternatively, one can use the p-adic metric on formula_54: given two sequences formula_55, the distance between them is formula_56, where formula_57 is the smallest index such that formula_58; if there is no such index, then the two sequences are the same, and one defines the distance to be zero. These two metrics generate the same topology on the Cantor set.\n\nWe have seen above that the Cantor set is a totally disconnected perfect compact metric space. Indeed, in a sense it is the only one: every nonempty totally disconnected perfect compact metric space is homeomorphic to the Cantor set. See Cantor space for more on spaces homeomorphic to the Cantor set.\n\nThe Cantor set is sometimes regarded as \"universal\" in the category of compact metric spaces, since any compact metric space is a continuous image of the Cantor set; however this construction is not unique and so the Cantor set is not universal in the precise categorical sense. The \"universal\" property has important applications in functional analysis, where it is sometimes known as the \"representation theorem for compact metric spaces\".\n\nFor any integer \"q\" ≥ 2, the topology on the group G=Z (the countable direct sum) is discrete. Although the Pontrjagin dual Γ is also Z, the topology of Γ is compact. One can see that Γ is totally disconnected and perfect - thus it is homeomorphic to the Cantor set. It is easiest to write out the homeomorphism explicitly in the case \"q\"=2. (See Rudin 1962 p 40.)\n\nThe Cantor set can be seen as the compact group of binary sequences, and as such, it is endowed with a natural Haar measure. When normalized so that the measure of the set is 1, it is a model of an infinite sequence of coin tosses. Furthermore, one can show that the usual Lebesgue measure on the interval is an image of the Haar measure on the Cantor set, while the natural injection into the ternary set is a canonical example of a singular measure. It can also be shown that the Haar measure is an image of any probability, making the Cantor set a universal probability space in some ways.\n\nIn Lebesgue measure theory, the Cantor set is an example of a set which is uncountable and has zero measure.\n\nIf we define a Cantor number as a member of the Cantor set, then\n\nInstead of repeatedly removing the middle third of every piece as in the Cantor set, we could also keep removing any other fixed percentage (other than 0% and 100%) from the middle. In the case where the middle / of the interval is removed, we get a remarkably accessible case — the set consists of all numbers in [0,1] that can be written as a decimal consisting entirely of 0s and 9s.\n\nBy removing progressively smaller percentages of the remaining pieces in every step, one can also construct sets homeomorphic to the Cantor set that have positive Lebesgue measure, while still being nowhere dense. See Smith–Volterra–Cantor set for an example.\n\nNatural fractals do not appear in a blink of an eye rather through evolution in time accompanied by some randomness since nature likes to enjoy freedom of choice. One can modify the construction of the Cantor set by dividing\nrandomly instead of equally. Besides, to incorporate time we can divide only one of the available intervals at each step instead of dividing all the available intervals. In the case of stochastic triadic Cantor set the resulting process can be described by the following rate equation\n\nand for the stochastic dyadic Cantor set\n\nwhere formula_61 is the number of intervals of size between formula_34 and formula_63. In the case of triadic Cantor set the fractal dimension is formula_64 which is \nless than its deterministic counterpart formula_65. In the case of stochastic dyadic Cantor set\nthe fractal dimension is formula_66 which is again less than that of its deterministic counterpart formula_67. In the case of stochastic dyadic Cantor set the solution for formula_68 exhibits dynamic scaling as its solution in the long-time limit is formula_69 where the fractal dimension of the stochastic dyadic Cantor set formula_70. In either case, like triadic Cantor set, the formula_39th moment (formula_72) of stochastic triadic and dyadic Cantor set too are conserved quantities.\n\nCantor dust is a multi-dimensional version of the Cantor set. It can be formed by taking a finite Cartesian product of the Cantor set with itself, making it a Cantor space. Like the Cantor set, Cantor dust has zero measure.\n\nA different 2D analogue of the Cantor set is the Sierpinski carpet, where a square is divided up into nine smaller squares, and the middle one removed. The remaining squares are then further divided into nine each and the middle removed, and so on ad infinitum. The 3D analogue of this is the Menger sponge.\n\nCantor himself defined the set in a general, abstract way, and mentioned the ternary construction only in passing, as an example of a more general idea, that of a perfect set that is nowhere dense. The original paper provides several different constructions of the abstract concept.\n\nThis set would have been considered abstract at the time when Cantor devised it. Cantor himself was led to it by practical concerns about the set of points where a trigonometric series might fail to converge. The discovery did much to set him on the course for developing an abstract, general theory of infinite sets.\n\nA column capital from the Ancient Egyptian site of the island of Philae carries a pattern which resembles the Cantor set. Cantor may have seen the image, as his cousin was an Egyptologist.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6173", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6173", "title": "Cardinal number", "text": "Cardinal number\n\nIn mathematics, cardinal numbers, or cardinals for short, are a generalization of the natural numbers used to measure the cardinality (size) of sets. The cardinality of a finite set is a natural number: the number of elements in the set. The \"transfinite\" cardinal numbers describe the sizes of infinite sets.\n\nCardinality is defined in terms of bijective functions. Two sets have the same cardinality if, and only if, there is a one-to-one correspondence (bijection) between the elements of the two sets. In the case of finite sets, this agrees with the intuitive notion of size. In the case of infinite sets, the behavior is more complex. A fundamental theorem due to Georg Cantor shows that it is possible for infinite sets to have different cardinalities, and in particular the cardinality of the set of real numbers is greater than the cardinality of the set of natural numbers. It is also possible for a proper subset of an infinite set to have the same cardinality as the original set, something that cannot happen with proper subsets of finite sets.\n\nThere is a transfinite sequence of cardinal numbers:\nThis sequence starts with the natural numbers including zero (finite cardinals), which are followed by the aleph numbers (infinite cardinals of well-ordered sets). The aleph numbers are indexed by ordinal numbers. Under the assumption of the axiom of choice, this transfinite sequence includes every cardinal number. If one rejects that axiom, the situation is more complicated, with additional infinite cardinals that are not alephs.\n\nCardinality is studied for its own sake as part of set theory. It is also a tool used in branches of mathematics including model theory, combinatorics, abstract algebra, and mathematical analysis. In category theory, the cardinal numbers form a skeleton of the category of sets.\n\nThe notion of cardinality, as now understood, was formulated by Georg Cantor, the originator of set theory, in 1874–1884. Cardinality can be used to compare an aspect of finite sets; e.g. the sets {1,2,3} and {4,5,6} are not \"equal\", but have the \"same cardinality\", namely three (this is established by the existence of a bijection, i.e. a one-to-one correspondence, between the two sets; e.g. {1→4, 2→5, 3→6}).\n\nCantor applied his concept of bijection to infinite sets; e.g. the set of natural numbers N = {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}. Thus, all sets having a bijection with N he called denumerable (countably infinite) sets and they all have the same cardinal number. This cardinal number is called formula_2, aleph-null. He called the cardinal numbers of these infinite sets transfinite cardinal numbers.\n\nCantor proved that any unbounded subset of N has the same cardinality as N, even though this might appear to run contrary to intuition. He also proved that the set of all ordered pairs of natural numbers is denumerable; this implies that the set of all rational numbers is also denumerable, since every rational can be represented by a pair of integers. He later proved that the set of all real algebraic numbers is also denumerable. Each real algebraic number \"z\" may be encoded as a finite sequence of integers which are the coefficients in the polynomial equation of which it is a solution, i.e. the ordered n-tuple (\"a\", \"a\", ..., \"a\"), \"a\" ∈ Z together with a pair of rationals (\"b\", \"b\") such that \"z\" is the unique root of the polynomial with coefficients (\"a\", \"a\", ..., \"a\") that lies in the interval (\"b\", \"b\").\n\nIn his 1874 paper \"On a Property of the Collection of All Real Algebraic Numbers\", Cantor proved that there exist higher-order cardinal numbers by showing that the set of real numbers has cardinality greater than that of N. His proof used an argument with nested intervals, but in an 1891 paper he proved the same result using his ingenious but simpler diagonal argument. The new cardinal number of the set of real numbers is called the cardinality of the continuum and Cantor used the symbol formula_3 for it.\n\nCantor also developed a large portion of the general theory of cardinal numbers; he proved that there is a smallest transfinite cardinal number (formula_2, aleph-null), and that for every cardinal number there is a next-larger cardinal\n\nHis continuum hypothesis is the proposition that formula_3 is the same as formula_7. This hypothesis has been found to be independent of the standard axioms of mathematical set theory; it can neither be proved nor disproved from the standard assumptions.\n\nIn informal use, a cardinal number is what is normally referred to as a \"counting number\", provided that 0 is included: 0, 1, 2, ... They may be identified with the natural numbers beginning with 0. The counting numbers are exactly what can be defined formally as the finite cardinal numbers. Infinite cardinals only occur in higher-level mathematics and logic.\n\nMore formally, a non-zero number can be used for two purposes: to describe the size of a set, or to describe the position of an element in a sequence. For finite sets and sequences it is easy to see that these two notions coincide, since for every number describing a position in a sequence we can construct a set which has exactly the right size, e.g. 3 describes the position of 'c' in the sequence <'a','b','c','d'...>, and we can construct the set {a,b,c} which has 3 elements. However, when dealing with infinite sets it is essential to distinguish between the two — the two notions are in fact different for infinite sets. Considering the position aspect leads to ordinal numbers, while the size aspect is generalized by the cardinal numbers described here.\n\nThe intuition behind the formal definition of cardinal is the construction of a notion of the relative size or \"bigness\" of a set without reference to the kind of members which it has. For finite sets this is easy; one simply counts the number of elements a set has. In order to compare the sizes of larger sets, it is necessary to appeal to more subtle notions.\n\nA set \"Y\" is at least as big as a set \"X\" if there is an injective mapping from the elements of \"X\" to the elements of \"Y\". An injective mapping identifies each element of the set \"X\" with a unique element of the set \"Y\". This is most easily understood by an example; suppose we have the sets \"X\" = {1,2,3} and \"Y\" = {a,b,c,d}, then using this notion of size we would observe that there is a mapping:\nwhich is injective, and hence conclude that \"Y\" has cardinality greater than or equal to \"X\". Note the element d has no element mapping to it, but this is permitted as we only require an injective mapping, and not necessarily an injective and onto mapping. The advantage of this notion is that it can be extended to infinite sets.\n\nWe can then extend this to an equality-style relation. Two sets \"X\" and \"Y\" are said to have the same cardinality if there exists a bijection between \"X\" and \"Y\". By the Schroeder–Bernstein theorem, this is equivalent to there being \"both\" an injective mapping from \"X\" to \"Y\" \"and\" an injective mapping from \"Y\" to \"X\". We then write |\"X\"| = |\"Y\"|. The cardinal number of \"X\" itself is often defined as the least ordinal \"a\" with |\"a\"| = |\"X\"|. This is called the von Neumann cardinal assignment; for this definition to make sense, it must be proved that every set has the same cardinality as \"some\" ordinal; this statement is the well-ordering principle. It is however possible to discuss the relative cardinality of sets without explicitly assigning names to objects.\n\nThe classic example used is that of the infinite hotel paradox, also called Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel. Suppose you are an innkeeper at a hotel with an infinite number of rooms. The hotel is full, and then a new guest arrives. It is possible to fit the extra guest in by asking the guest who was in room 1 to move to room 2, the guest in room 2 to move to room 3, and so on, leaving room 1 vacant. We can explicitly write a segment of this mapping:\nIn this way we can see that the set {1,2,3...} has the same cardinality as the set {2,3,4...} since a bijection between the first and the second has been shown. This motivates the definition of an infinite set being any set which has a proper subset of the same cardinality; in this case {2,3,4...} is a proper subset of {1,2,3...}.\n\nWhen considering these large objects, we might also want to see if the notion of counting order coincides with that of cardinal defined above for these infinite sets. It happens that it doesn't; by considering the above example we can see that if some object \"one greater than infinity\" exists, then it must have the same cardinality as the infinite set we started out with. It is possible to use a different formal notion for number, called ordinals, based on the ideas of counting and considering each number in turn, and we discover that the notions of cardinality and ordinality are divergent once we move out of the finite numbers.\n\nIt can be proved that the cardinality of the real numbers is greater than that of the natural numbers just described. This can be visualized using Cantor's diagonal argument;\nclassic questions of cardinality (for instance the continuum hypothesis) are concerned with discovering whether there is some cardinal between some pair of other infinite cardinals. In more recent times mathematicians have been describing the properties of larger and larger cardinals.\n\nSince cardinality is such a common concept in mathematics, a variety of names are in use. Sameness of cardinality is sometimes referred to as equipotence, equipollence, or equinumerosity. It is thus said that two sets with the same cardinality are, respectively, equipotent, equipollent, or equinumerous.\n\nFormally, assuming the axiom of choice, the cardinality of a set \"X\" is the least ordinal number α such that there is a bijection between \"X\" and α. This definition is known as the von Neumann cardinal assignment. If the axiom of choice is not assumed we need to do something different. The oldest definition of the cardinality of a set \"X\" (implicit in Cantor and explicit in Frege and Principia Mathematica) is as the class \"[X]\" of all sets that are equinumerous with \"X\". This does not work in ZFC or other related systems of axiomatic set theory because if \"X\" is non-empty, this collection is too large to be a set. In fact, for \"X ≠ ∅\" there is an injection from the universe into \"[X]\" by mapping a set \"m\" to \"{m} × X\" and so by the axiom of limitation of size, \"[X]\" is a proper class. The definition does work however in type theory and in New Foundations and related systems. However, if we restrict from this class to those equinumerous with \"X\" that have the least rank, then it will work (this is a trick due to Dana Scott: it works because the collection of objects with any given rank is a set).\n\nFormally, the order among cardinal numbers is defined as follows: |\"X\"| ≤ |\"Y\"| means that there exists an injective function from \"X\" to \"Y\". The Cantor–Bernstein–Schroeder theorem states that if |\"X\"| ≤ |\"Y\"| and |\"Y\"| ≤ |\"X\"| then |\"X\"| = |\"Y\"|. The axiom of choice is equivalent to the statement that given two sets \"X\" and \"Y\", either |\"X\"| ≤ |\"Y\"| or |\"Y\"| ≤ |\"X\"|.\n\nA set \"X\" is Dedekind-infinite if there exists a proper subset \"Y\" of \"X\" with |\"X\"| = |\"Y\"|, and Dedekind-finite if such a subset doesn't exist. The finite cardinals are just the natural numbers, i.e., a set \"X\" is finite if and only if |\"X\"| = |\"n\"| = \"n\" for some natural number \"n\". Any other set is infinite. Assuming the axiom of choice, it can be proved that the Dedekind notions correspond to the standard ones. It can also be proved that the cardinal formula_2 (aleph null or aleph-0, where aleph is the first letter in the Hebrew alphabet, represented formula_9) of the set of natural numbers is the smallest infinite cardinal, i.e. that any infinite set has a subset of cardinality formula_10 The next larger cardinal is denoted by formula_7 and so on. For every ordinal α there is a cardinal number formula_12 and this list exhausts all infinite cardinal numbers.\n\nWe can define arithmetic operations on cardinal numbers that generalize the ordinary operations for natural numbers. It can be shown that for finite cardinals these operations coincide with the usual operations for natural numbers. Furthermore, these operations share many properties with ordinary arithmetic.\n\nIf the axiom of choice holds, every cardinal κ has a successor κ > κ, and there are no cardinals between κ and its successor. (Without the axiom of choice, using Hartogs' theorem, it can be shown that, for any cardinal number κ, there is a minimal cardinal κ, so that formula_13) For finite cardinals, the successor is simply κ + 1. For infinite cardinals, the successor cardinal differs from the successor ordinal.\n\nIf \"X\" and \"Y\" are disjoint, addition is given by the union of \"X\" and \"Y\". If the two sets are not already disjoint, then they can be replaced by disjoint sets of the same cardinality, e.g., replace \"X\" by \"X\"×{0} and \"Y\" by \"Y\"×{1}.\n\nZero is an additive identity \"κ\" + 0 = 0 + \"κ\" = \"κ\".\n\nAddition is associative (\"κ\" + \"μ\") + \"ν\" = \"κ\" + (\"μ\" + \"ν\").\n\nAddition is commutative \"κ\" + \"μ\" = \"μ\" + \"κ\".\n\nAddition is non-decreasing in both arguments:\n\nAssuming the axiom of choice, addition of infinite cardinal numbers is easy. If either κ or μ is infinite, then\n\nAssuming the axiom of choice and, given an infinite cardinal σ and a cardinal μ, there exists a cardinal κ such that μ + κ = σ if and only if μ ≤ σ. It will be unique (and equal to σ) if and only if μ < σ.\n\nThe product of cardinals comes from the cartesian product.\n\n\"κ\"·0 = 0·\"κ\" = 0.\n\n\"κ\"·\"μ\" = 0 → (\"κ\" = 0 or \"μ\" = 0).\n\nOne is a multiplicative identity \"κ\"·1 = 1·\"κ\" = \"κ\".\n\nMultiplication is associative (\"κ\"·\"μ\")·\"ν\" = \"κ\"·(\"μ\"·\"ν\").\n\nMultiplication is commutative \"κ\"·\"μ\" = \"μ\"·\"κ\".\n\nMultiplication is non-decreasing in both arguments:\n\"κ\" ≤ \"μ\" → (\"κ\"·\"ν\" ≤ \"μ\"·\"ν\" and \"ν\"·\"κ\" ≤ \"ν\"·\"μ\").\n\nMultiplication distributes over addition:\n\"κ\"·(\"μ\" + \"ν\") = \"κ\"·\"μ\" + \"κ\"·\"ν\" and\n(\"μ\" + \"ν\")·\"κ\" = \"μ\"·\"κ\" + \"ν\"·\"κ\".\n\nAssuming the axiom of choice, multiplication of infinite cardinal numbers is also easy. If either \"κ\" or \"μ\" is infinite and both are non-zero, then\n\nAssuming the axiom of choice and, given an infinite cardinal \"π\" and a non-zero cardinal μ, there exists a cardinal κ such that μ · κ = \"π\" if and only if μ ≤ \"π\". It will be unique (and equal to \"π\") if and only if μ < \"π\".\n\nExponentiation is given by\nwhere \"X\" is the set of all functions from \"Y\" to \"X\".\n\nExponentiation is non-decreasing in both arguments:\n\nNote that 2 is the cardinality of the power set of the set \"X\" and Cantor's diagonal argument shows that 2 > |\"X\"| for any set \"X\". This proves that no largest cardinal exists (because for any cardinal \"κ\", we can always find a larger cardinal 2). In fact, the class of cardinals is a proper class. (This proof fails in some set theories, notably New Foundations.)\n\nAll the remaining propositions in this section assume the axiom of choice:\n\nIf 2 ≤ κ and 1 ≤ μ and at least one of them is infinite, then:\n\nUsing König's theorem, one can prove κ < κ and κ < cf(2) for any infinite cardinal κ, where cf(κ) is the cofinality of κ.\n\nAssuming the axiom of choice and, given an infinite cardinal κ and a finite cardinal μ greater than 0, the cardinal ν satisfying formula_20 will be κ.\n\nAssuming the axiom of choice and, given an infinite cardinal κ and a finite cardinal μ greater than 1, there may or may not be a cardinal λ satisfying formula_21. However, if such a cardinal exists, it is infinite and less than κ, and any finite cardinality ν greater than 1 will also satisfy formula_22.\n\nThe logarithm of an infinite cardinal number κ is defined as the least cardinal number μ such that κ ≤ 2. Logarithms of infinite cardinals are useful in some fields of mathematics, for example in the study of cardinal invariants of topological spaces, though they lack some of the properties that logarithms of positive real numbers possess.\n\nThe continuum hypothesis (CH) states that there are no cardinals strictly between formula_2 and formula_24 The latter cardinal number is also often denoted by formula_3; it is the cardinality of the continuum (the set of real numbers). In this case formula_26 The generalized continuum hypothesis (GCH) states that for every infinite set \"X\", there are no cardinals strictly between | \"X\" | and 2. The continuum hypothesis is independent of the usual axioms of set theory, the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms together with the axiom of choice (ZFC).\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}

For example, the set A = {2, 4, 6} contains 3 elements, and therefore A has a cardinality of 3. There are two approaches to cardinality – one which compares sets directly using bijections and injections, and another which uses cardinal numbers.\nThe cardinality of a set is also called its size, when no confusion with other notions of size is possible.\n\nThe cardinality of a set \"A\" is usually denoted | \"A\" |, with a vertical bar on each side; this is the same notation as absolute value and the meaning depends on context. Alternatively, the cardinality of a set \"A\" may be denoted by n(\"A\"), \"A\", card(\"A\"), or # \"A\".\n\nWhile the cardinality of a finite set is just the number of its elements, extending the notion to infinite sets usually starts with defining the notion of comparison of arbitrary (in particular infinite) sets.\n\nIf | \"A\" | ≤ | \"B\" | and | \"B\" | ≤ | \"A\" | then | \"A\" | = | \"B\" | (Cantor–Bernstein–Schroeder theorem). The axiom of choice is equivalent to the statement that | \"A\" | ≤ | \"B\" | or | \"B\" | ≤ | \"A\" | for every \"A\",\"B\".\n\nAbove, \"cardinality\" was defined functionally. That is, the \"cardinality\" of a set was not defined as a specific object itself. However, such an object can be defined as follows.\n\nThe relation of having the same cardinality is called equinumerosity, and this is an equivalence relation on the class of all sets. The equivalence class of a set \"A\" under this relation then consists of all those sets which have the same cardinality as \"A\". There are two ways to define the \"cardinality of a set\":\n\n\nAssuming AC, the cardinalities of the infinite sets are denoted\nFor each ordinal formula_2, formula_3 is the least cardinal number greater than formula_4.\n\nThe cardinality of the natural numbers is denoted aleph-null (formula_5), while the cardinality of the real numbers is denoted by \"formula_6\" (a lowercase fraktur script \"c\"), and is also referred to as the cardinality of the continuum. Cantor showed, using the diagonal argument, that formula_7. We can show that formula_8, this also being the cardinality of the set of all subsets of the natural numbers. The continuum hypothesis says that formula_9, i.e. formula_10 is the smallest cardinal number bigger than formula_5, i.e. there is no set whose cardinality is strictly between that of the integers and that of the real numbers.\nThe continuum hypothesis is independent of ZFC, a standard axiomatization of set theory; that is, it is impossible to prove the continuum hypothesis or its negation from ZFC (provided ZFC is consistent). See below for more details on the cardinality of the continuum.\n\nIf the axiom of choice holds, the law of trichotomy holds for cardinality. Thus we can make the following definitions:\n\n\nOur intuition gained from finite sets breaks down when dealing with infinite sets. In the late nineteenth century Georg Cantor, Gottlob Frege, Richard Dedekind and others rejected the view that the whole cannot be the same size as the part. One example of this is Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel.\nIndeed, Dedekind defined an infinite set as one that can be placed into a one-to-one correspondence with a strict subset (that is, having the same size in Cantor's sense); this notion of infinity is called Dedekind infinite. Cantor introduced the cardinal numbers, and showed that (according to his bijection-based definition of size) some infinite sets are greater than others. The smallest infinite cardinality is that of the natural numbers (formula_5).\n\nOne of Cantor's most important results was that the cardinality of the continuum (formula_15) is greater than that of the natural numbers (formula_5); that is, there are more real numbers R than whole numbers N. Namely, Cantor showed that formula_17 (see Beth one) satisfies:\n\nThe continuum hypothesis states that there is no cardinal number between the cardinality of the reals and the cardinality of the natural numbers, that is,\n\nHowever, this hypothesis can neither be proved nor disproved within the widely accepted ZFC axiomatic set theory, if ZFC is consistent.\n\nCardinal arithmetic can be used to show not only that the number of points in a real number line is equal to the number of points in any segment of that line, but that this is equal to the number of points on a plane and, indeed, in any finite-dimensional space. These results are highly counterintuitive, because they imply that there exist proper subsets and proper supersets of an infinite set \"S\" that have the same size as \"S\", although \"S\" contains elements that do not belong to its subsets, and the supersets of \"S\" contain elements that are not included in it.\n\nThe first of these results is apparent by considering, for instance, the tangent function, which provides a one-to-one correspondence between the interval (−½π, ½π) and R (see also Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel).\n\nThe second result was first demonstrated by Cantor in 1878, but it became more apparent in 1890, when Giuseppe Peano introduced the space-filling curves, curved lines that twist and turn enough to fill the whole of any square, or cube, or hypercube, or finite-dimensional space. These curves are not a direct proof that a line has the same number of points as a finite-dimensional space, but they can be used to obtain such a proof.\n\nCantor also showed that sets with cardinality strictly greater than formula_6 exist (see his generalized diagonal argument and theorem). They include, for instance:\n\nBoth have cardinality\n\nThe cardinal equalities formula_22 formula_23 and formula_24 can be demonstrated using cardinal arithmetic:\n\n\nIf \"A\" and \"B\" are \"disjoint\" sets, then\n\nFrom this, one can show that in general the cardinalities of unions and intersections are related by\n\n"}
{"id": "6176", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6176", "title": "Cecil B. DeMille", "text": "Cecil B. DeMille\n\nCecil Blount DeMille (; August 12, 1881 – January 21, 1959) was an American filmmaker. Between 1913 and 1956, he made a total of 70 features, both silent and sound films. He is acknowledged as a founding father of the cinema of the United States and the most commercially successful producer-director in film history. His films were distinguished by their epic scale and by his cinematic showmanship. He made silent films of every genre: social dramas, comedies, Westerns, farces, morality plays, and historical pageants.\n\nDeMille began his career as a stage actor in 1900. He later moved to writing and directing stage productions, some with Jesse Lasky, who was then a vaudeville producer. DeMille's first film, \"The Squaw Man\" (1914), was also the first feature film shot in Hollywood. Its interracial love story made it a phenomenal hit and it \"put Hollywood on the map.\" The continued success of his productions led to the founding of Paramount Pictures with Lasky and Adolph Zukor. His first biblical epic, \"The Ten Commandments\" (1923), was both a critical and financial success; it held the Paramount revenue record for twenty-five years.\n\nIn 1927, he directed \"The King of Kings\", a biography of Jesus of Nazareth, which was acclaimed for its sensitivity and reached more than 800 million viewers. \"The Sign of the Cross\" (1932) was the first sound film to integrate all aspects of cinematic technique. \"Cleopatra\" (1934) was his first film to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. After more than thirty years in film production, DeMille reached the pinnacle of his career with \"Samson and Delilah\" (1949), a biblical epic which did \"an all-time record business.\" Along with biblical and historical narratives, he also directed films oriented toward \"neo-naturalism,\" which tried to portray the laws of man fighting the forces of nature.\n\nHe went on to receive his first nomination for the Academy Award for Best Director for his circus drama \"The Greatest Show on Earth\" (1952), which won the Academy Award for Best Picture. His last and most famous film, \"The Ten Commandments\" (1956), is currently the seventh-highest-grossing film of all time, adjusted for inflation. In addition to his Best Picture Award, he received an Academy Honorary Award for his film contributions, the Palme d'Or (posthumously) for \"Union Pacific\", a DGA Award for Lifetime Achievement, and the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award. He was also the first recipient of the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award, which was later named in his honor.\n\nThere are several variants of DeMille's surname. His family's Dutch surname was originally spelled \"de Mil\" and then became \"de Mille\". As an adult, he adopted the spelling \"DeMille\" for professional purposes but continued to use \"de Mille\" in private life. The family name \"de Mille\" was used by his children Cecilia, John, Richard, and Katherine. DeMille's brother William and his daughters, Margaret and Agnes, as well as DeMille's granddaughter, Cecilia de Mille Presley, also used the \"de Mille\" spelling.\n\nCecil Blount DeMille was born in Ashfield, Massachusetts, while his parents were vacationing there, and grew up in Washington, North Carolina. His father, Henry Churchill de Mille (1853–1893), was a North Carolina-born dramatist and lay reader in the Episcopal Church, who had earlier begun a career as a playwright, writing his first play at age 15. His mother was Matilda Beatrice DeMille (née Samuel), whose parents were both of German Jewish heritage. She emigrated from England with her parents in 1871 when she was 18, and they settled in Brooklyn. Beatrice grew up in a middle-class English household. DeMille's mother was related to British politician Herbert Louis Samuel.\n\nDeMille's parents met as members of a music and literary society in New York. Henry was a tall, red-headed student. Beatrice was intelligent, educated, forthright, and strong-willed. They were both born in 1853 and both loved the theater. When they married, Beatrice converted to Henry's faith. Henry worked as a playwright, administrator, and faculty member during the early years of The American Academy of Dramatic Arts, established in New York City in 1884. He built a house for his family in Wayne, New Jersey.\n\nThe family spent time in Pompton Lakes, New Jersey, operating a private school in that town and attending Christ Episcopal Church. DeMille recalled that this church was the place where he visualized the story of his 1923 version of \"The Ten Commandments\". Henry read to his children nightly, both from the classics and from the Bible. DeMille studied Scripture his entire life and read the Bible during lunch in the studio commissary. He was the first to admit that he did not attend church services but he did profess an unshakable belief in prayer. He stated that his films were a continuation of his father's work. \"My ministry,\" said DeMille, \"has been to make religious movies and to get more people to read the Bible than anyone else ever has.\"\n\nIn 1893, at the age of forty, Henry de Mille contracted typhoid fever and died suddenly, leaving Beatrice with three children, a house, and no savings. Beatrice had \"enthusiastically supported\" her husband's theatrical aspirations. In his eulogy, she wrote:\n\nWithin eight weeks of Henry's death, Beatrice opened an acting workshop in her home, the Henry C. De Mille School for Girls. She later became the second female play broker on Broadway. DeMille attended Pennsylvania Military College in Chester, Pennsylvania from the age of fifteen. Both DeMille (Class of 1900) and his brother William (Class of 1901) also attended and graduated from the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, which they attended on scholarship. The Academy later honored DeMille with an Alumni Achievement Award.\n\nDeMille began his career as an actor on the Broadway stage in the theatrical company of Charles Frohman in 1900. His brother William was establishing himself as a playwright and sometimes invited him to collaborate. DeMille performed on stage with actors whom he would later direct in films: Charlotte Walker, Mary Pickford, and Pedro de Cordoba. DeMille also produced and directed plays. DeMille found success in the spring of 1913 producing \"Reckless Age\" by Lee Wilson, a play about a high society girl wrongly accused of manslaughter starring Frederick Burton and Sydney Shields. DeMille and his brother at times worked with the legendary impresario David Belasco, who had been a friend and collaborator of their father. Changes in the theater rendered DeMille's melodramas obsolete before they were produced, and true theatrical success eluded him. By 1913 he was having difficulty supporting his wife and baby daughter.\n\nIn July 1913 DeMille, Jesse Lasky, Sam Goldfish (later Samuel Goldwyn), and a group of East Coast businessmen created the Jesse L. Lasky Feature Play Company. On December 12, 1913, DeMille, his cast, and crew boarded a Southern Pacific train bound for Flagstaff via New Orleans. His tentative plan was to shoot a film in Arizona, but he disliked the quality of light he saw there. He continued to Los Angeles. Once there, he chose not to shoot in Edendale, where many studios were, but in Hollywood. He also flouted the dictum that a film should run twenty minutes. He made his first film run sixty minutes, as long as a short play. \"The Squaw Man\" (1914), co-directed by Oscar Apfel, was a sensation and it established the Lasky Company.\n\nThe first few years of the Lasky Company (soon to become Famous Players-Lasky) were spent in making films nonstop, literally writing the language of film. DeMille adapted Belasco's dramatic lighting techniques to film technology, mimicking moonlight with U.S. cinema's first attempts at \"motivated lighting\" in \"The Warrens of Virginia\"\n\nAfter five years and thirty hit films, DeMille became the American film industry's most successful director. In the silent era, he was renowned for \"Male and Female\" (1919), \"Manslaughter\" (1921), and \"The Godless Girl\" (1928). DeMille's trademark scenes included bathtubs, lion attacks, and Roman orgies. A number of his films featured scenes in two-color Technicolor.\n\nThe immense popularity of DeMille's silent films enabled him to branch out into other areas. The Roaring Twenties were the boom years and DeMille took full advantage, opening the Mercury Aviation Company, one of America's first commercial airlines. He was also a real estate speculator, an underwriter of political campaigns, and a Bank of America executive, approving loans for other filmmakers.\n\nWhen \"talking pictures\" were innovated in 1928, DeMille made a successful transition, offering his own innovations to the painful process; he devised a microphone boom and a soundproof camera blimp. He also popularized the camera crane.\n\nDeMille made stars of unknown actors: Gloria Swanson, Bebe Daniels, Rod La Rocque, William Boyd, Claudette Colbert, and Charlton Heston. He also cast established stars such as Gary Cooper, Robert Preston, Paulette Goddard and Fredric March in multiple pictures. DeMille displayed a loyalty to his performers, casting them repeatedly. They included Henry Wilcoxon, Julia Faye, Joseph Schildkraut, Ian Keith, Charles Bickford, Theodore Roberts, Akim Tamiroff and William Boyd. DeMille was credited by actor Edward G. Robinson with saving his career following his eclipse in the Hollywood blacklist.\nDeMille had a reputation for autocratic behavior on the set, singling out and berating extras who were not paying attention. A number of these displays were thought to be staged, however, as an exercise in discipline. He despised actors who were unwilling to take physical risks, especially when he had first demonstrated that the required stunt would not harm them. This occurred with Victor Mature in \"Samson and Delilah\". Mature refused to wrestle Jackie the Lion, even though DeMille had just tussled with the lion, proving that he was tame. DeMille told the actor that he was \"one hundred percent yellow\". Paulette Goddard's refusal to risk personal injury in a scene involving fire in \"Unconquered\" cost her DeMille's favor and a role in \"The Greatest Show on Earth\".\n\nDeMille was adept at directing \"thousands of extras\", and many of his pictures include spectacular setpieces: the toppling of the pagan temple in \"Samson and Delilah\"; train wrecks in \"The Road to Yesterday\", \"Union Pacific\" and \"The Greatest Show on Earth\"; the destruction of an airship in \"Madam Satan\"; and the parting of the Red Sea in both versions of \"The Ten Commandments\".\n\nDeMille first used three-strip Technicolor in \"North West Mounted Police\" (1940). Audiences liked its highly saturated color, so DeMille made no further black-and-white features.\n\nDeMille was one of the first directors to become a celebrity in his own right. He cultivated the image of the omnipotent director, complete with megaphone, riding crop, and jodhpurs. From 1936 to 1944, DeMille hosted \"Lux Radio Theater\", a weekly digest of current feature films.\n\nDeMille was respected by his peers, yet his individual films were sometimes criticized. \"Directorially, I think his pictures were the most horrible things I've ever seen in my life\", said director William Wellman. \"But he put on pictures that made a fortune. In that respect, he was better than any of us.\" \nProducer David O. Selznick wrote: \"There has appeared only one Cecil B. DeMille. He is one of the most extraordinarily able showmen of modern times. However much I may dislike some of his pictures, it would be very silly of me, as a producer of commercial motion pictures, to demean for an instant his unparalleled skill as a maker of mass entertainment.\"\n\nDeMille appeared as himself in numerous films, including the M-G-M comedy \"Free and Easy.\" He often appeared in his coming-attraction trailers and narrated many of his later films, even stepping on screen to introduce \"The Ten Commandments\". DeMille was immortalized in Billy Wilder's \"Sunset Boulevard\" when Gloria Swanson spoke the line: \"All right, Mr. DeMille. I'm ready for my closeup.\" DeMille plays himself in the film.\n\nIn the 1940s DeMille continued to please the public. He averaged one film a year; most of them centered on historical figures or Bible stories. His first attempt at a drama set within a semi-documentary frame was \"The Greatest Show on Earth\", a saga of circus performers released in 1952. His experiment gained him a nomination for best director and won an Oscar for best picture.\n\nIn 1954, DeMille began his last film, the production for which he is best remembered, \"The Ten Commandments\".\n\nOn November 7, 1954, while in Egypt filming the Exodus sequence for \"The Ten Commandments\", DeMille (who was seventy-three) climbed a ladder to the top of the massive Per Rameses set and suffered a serious heart attack. Ignoring his doctor's orders, DeMille was back directing the film within a week. Although DeMille completed the film, his health was diminished by several more heart attacks. This film would be his last.\n\nBecause of his illness, DeMille asked his son-in-law, actor Anthony Quinn, to direct a remake of his 1938 film \"The Buccaneer\". DeMille served as executive producer. Despite a cast led by Charlton Heston and Yul Brynner, the 1958 film \"The Buccaneer\" was a disappointment.\n\nIn the months before his death, DeMille was researching a film biography of Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell, the founder of the Scout Movement. DeMille asked David Niven to star in the film, but it was never made. DeMille also was planning a film about the space race as well as another Biblical epic about the Book of Revelation.\n\nDeMille married Constance Adams on August 16, 1902 and had one child, Cecilia. The couple also adopted an orphan child, Katherine Lester, in the early 1920s; her father had been killed in World War I and her mother had died of tuberculosis.\n\nKatherine became an actress at Paramount Pictures, ultimately gaining his approval. In 1937 she married actor Anthony Quinn. In the 1920s the DeMilles adopted two sons, John and Richard, the latter of whom became a notable filmmaker, writer, and psychologist.\n\nDeMille was a Freemason and a member of Prince of Orange Lodge #16 in New York City.\n\nCecil had an older brother William, and a sister Agnes who died in childhood. William later named a daughter after her, Agnes de Mille, the famed dancer-choreographer.\n\nDeMille was a lifelong conservative Republican activist. He greatly admired Herbert Hoover. In 1944, he was the master of ceremonies at the massive rally organized by David O. Selznick in the Los Angeles Coliseum in support of the Dewey-Bricker ticket as well as Governor Earl Warren of California, who would become Dewey's running mate in 1948 and later the Chief Justice of the United States. The gathering drew 93,000, with short speeches by Hedda Hopper and Walt Disney. Among those in attendance were Ann Sothern, Ginger Rogers, Randolph Scott, Adolphe Menjou, Gary Cooper, and Walter Pidgeon. Though the rally drew a good response, most Hollywood celebrities who took a public position sided with the Roosevelt-Truman ticket.\n\nIn 1954, Secretary of the Air Force Harold E. Talbott asked DeMille for help in designing the cadet uniforms at the newly established United States Air Force Academy. DeMille's designs, most notably his design of the distinctive cadet parade uniform, won praise from Air Force and Academy leadership, were ultimately adopted, and are still worn by cadets.\n\nIn the early 1950s, DeMille was recruited by Allen Dulles and Frank Wisner to serve on the board of the anti-communist National Committee for a Free Europe, the public face of the organization that oversaw the Radio Free Europe service.\n\nDeMille drew on his Jewish and Protestant heritage to convey a message of tolerance. \"The Crusades\" was the first film to show accord between Christians and Muslims. DeMille received more than a dozen awards from Jewish religious and cultural groups, including B’nai B’rith.\n\nIn 1954, he was seeking approval for a lavish remake of his 1923 silent film \"The Ten Commandments\". He went before the Paramount board of directors, which was mostly Jewish-American. The members rejected his proposal, even though his last two films, \"Samson and Delilah\" and \"The Greatest Show on Earth\", had been record-breaking hits. Adolph Zukor, the chairman of the board, rebuked the members, saying: “We have just lived through a war where our people were systematically executed. Here we have a man who made a film praising the Jewish people, that tells of Samson, one of the legends of our Scripture. Now he wants to make the life of Moses. We should get down on our knees to Cecil and say ‘Thank you!’” DeMille did not have an exact budget proposal for the project, and it promised to be the most costly in U.S. film history. Still, the members unanimously approved it.\n\nIn the early hours of January 21, 1959, DeMille died of heart failure.\n\nDeMille's funeral was held on January 23 at St. Stephen's Episcopal Church. He was entombed at the Hollywood Memorial Cemetery (now known as Hollywood Forever).\n\nDeMille received hundreds of awards, commendations, and honors in his lifetime.\n\nFor his contribution to the motion picture and radio industry, DeMille has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The first, for radio contributions, is located at 6240 Vine Street. The second star is located at 1725 Vine Street.\n\nTwo schools are named after him: Cecil B. DeMille Middle School, in Long Beach, California, closed and demolished in 2007 to make way for a new high school; and Cecil B. DeMille Elementary School in Midway City, California.\n\nThe former film building at Chapman University in Orange, California is named in honor of DeMille. The Lawrence and Kristina Dodge College of Film and Media Arts now resides in Marion Knotts Studios.\n\nThe Golden Globe's annual Cecil B. DeMille Award recognizes lifetime achievement in the film industry.\n\nThe moving image collection of Cecil B. DeMille is held at the Academy Film Archive and includes home movies, outtakes, and never-before-seen test footage.\n\nDeMille made seventy features. In spite of careful storage in his film vaults, seven films were lost to nitrate decomposition; all were early silent films. The titles are: \"The Arab\", \"The Wild Goose Chase\", \"Chimmie Fadden\", \"The Dream Girl\", \"We Can't Have Everything\", \"The Devil Stone\", and \"The Squaw Man\" (the 1918 remake). Roughly twenty of his silent features are available in commercial DVD format.\n\nThe sound films are in three groups:\n\n1. The three films DeMille produced at M-G-M are now owned by Warner Bros. (through Turner Entertainment).\n\n2. The films he made at Paramount between 1932 and 1947 were sold by that company to EMKA, Ltd. in 1957, and are available through the television division of NBCUniversal.\n\n3. DeMille's last three films were not sold to EMKA, and at present remain with Paramount.

{"id": "6181", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6181", "title": "Chinese Islamic cuisine", "text": "Chinese Islamic cuisine\n\nChinese Islamic cuisine (, Dungan: Чыңжән цаы or , Dungan: Ҳуэйзў цаы) is the cuisine of the Hui (ethnic Chinese Muslims) and other Muslims living in China such as Dongxiang, Salar and Bonan as well as Dungans of Central Asia.\nDue to the large Muslim population in western China, many Chinese restaurants cater to, or are run by, Muslims. Northern Chinese Islamic cuisine originated in China proper. It is heavily influenced by Beijing cuisine, with nearly all cooking methods identical, and differs only in material due to religious restrictions. As a result, northern Islamic cuisine is often included in home Beijing cuisine, however seldom in east coast restaurants.\n\nDuring the Yuan dynasty, halal methods of slaughtering animals and preparing food was banned and forbidden by the Mongol Emperors, starting with Genghis Khan who banned Muslims and Jews from slaughtering their animals their own way, and making them follow the Mongol method.\nAmong all the [subject] alien peoples only the Hui-hui say “we do not eat Mongol food”. [Cinggis Qa’an replied:] “By the aid of heaven we have pacified you; you are our slaves. Yet you do not eat our food or drink. How can this be right?” He thereupon made them eat. “If you slaughter sheep, you will be considered guilty of a crime.” He issued a regulation to that effect ... [In 1279/1280 under Qubilai] all the Muslims say: “if someone else slaughters [the animal] we do not eat”. Because the poor people are upset by this, from now on, Musuluman [Muslim] Huihui and Zhuhu [Jewish] Huihui, no matter who kills [the animal] will eat [it] and must cease slaughtering sheep themselves, and cease the rite of circumcision.\nTraditionally, there is a distinction between northern and southern Chinese Islamic cuisine despite both utilizing mutton and lamb. Northern Chinese Islamic cuisine relies heavily on beef, but rarely ducks, geese, shrimp or seafood, while southern Islamic cuisine is the reverse. The reason for this difference is due to availability of the ingredients. Oxen have been long used for farming and Chinese governments have frequently strictly prohibited the slaughter of oxen for food. However, due to the geographic proximity of the northern part of China to minority-dominated regions that were not subjected to such restrictions, beef could be easily purchased and transported to northern China. At the same time, ducks, geese, and shrimp are rare in comparison to southern China due to the arid climate of northern China.\n\nA Chinese Islamic restaurant () can be similar to a Mandarin restaurant with the exception that there is no pork on the menu and is primarily noodle/soup based.\n\nIn most major eastern cities in China, there are very limited Islamic/Halal restaurants, which are typically run by migrants from Western China (e.g., Uyghurs), they primarily offer inexpensive noodle soups only. These restaurants are typically decorated with Islamic motifs such as pictures of Islamic rugs and Arabic writing.\n\nAnother difference is that lamb and mutton dishes are more commonly available than in other Chinese restaurants, due to the greater prevalence of these meats in the cuisine of western Chinese regions. (Refer to image 1.)\n\nOther Muslim ethnic minorities like the Salar, Dongxiang, Bonan, and Tibetan Muslims have their own cuisines as well. Dongxiang people also operate their own restaurants serving their cuisine.\n\nMany cafeterias (canteens) at Chinese universities have separate sections or dining areas for Muslim students (Hui or western Chinese minorities), typically labeled \"qingzhen.\" Student ID cards sometimes indicate whether a student is Muslim, and will allow access to these dining areas, or will allow access on special occasions such as the Eid feast following Ramadan.\n\nSeveral Hui restaurants serving Chinese Islamic cuisine exist in Los Angeles. San Francisco, despite its huge number of Chinese restaurants, appears to have only one whose cuisine would qualify as Halal.\n\nMany Chinese Hui Muslims who moved from Yunnan to Burma (Myanmar) are known as Panthays operate restaurants and stalls serving Chinese Islamic cuisine such as noodles. Chinese Hui Muslims from Yunnan who moved to Thailand are known as Chin Haw and they also own restaurants and stalls serving Chinese Islamic food.\nIn Central Asia, Dungan people, descendants of Hui, operate restaurants serving Chinese Islamic cuisine which is respectively referred to as \"Dungan cuisine\" there. They cater to Chinese businessmen. Chopsticks are used by Dungans. The cuisine of the Dungan resembles northwestern Chinese cuisine.\n\nMost Chinese regard Hui Halal food as cleaner than food made by non Muslims so their restaurants are popular in China. Hui who migrated to Northeast China (Manchuria) after the Chuang Guandong opened many new inns and restaurants to cater to travellers, which were regarded as clean.\n\nThe Hui who migrated to Taiwan also operate Qingzhen restaurants and stalls serving Chinese Islamic cuisine in Taipei and other big cities.\n\nThe Thai Department of Export Promotion claims that \"China's halal food producers are small-scale entrepreneurs whose products have little value added and lack branding and technology to push their goods to international standards\" to encourage Thai private sector Halal producers to market their products in China.\n\nA 1903 started franchise which serves Muslim food is Dong Lai Shun in Hankou.\n\n400 meters have to be kept as a distance from each restaurant serving beef noodles to another of its type if they belong to Hui Muslims, since Hui have a pact between each other in Ningxia, Gansu, and Shaanxi.\n\nHalal restaurants are checked up upon by clerics from Mosques.\n\nHalal food manufacture has been sanctioned by the government of the Ningxia Autonomous region.\n\nLamian (Refer to image 2.) ( Dungan: Ламян) is a Chinese dish of hand-made noodles, usually served in a beef or mutton-flavored soup (湯麵 даңмян tāngmiàn), but sometimes stir-fried (炒麵 Чаомян chǎomiàn) and served with a tomato-based sauce. Literally, 拉 ла (lā) means to pull or stretch, while 麵 мян (miàn) means noodle. The hand-making process involves taking a lump of dough and repeatedly stretching it to produce a single very long noodle.\n\nIt was noted that words that begin with L are not native to Turkic so that läghmän is a loanword as stated by Uyghur linguist Abdlikim so it is of Chinese derivation and not originally Uyghur. L starting words are not native to Turkic. Words which begin with R and L which are \"initial liquids\", are not native to Turkic.\n\nBeef noodle soup (Refer to image 3.) is a noodle soup dish composed of stewed beef, beef broth, vegetables and wheat noodles. It exists in various forms throughout East Asia and Southeast Asia. The most common Vietnamese version is called Bo kho, but which uses rice noodles instead. It was created by the Hui people during the Tang Dynasty of China.\n\nIn the West, this food may be served in a small portion as a soup. In China, a large bowl of it is often taken as a whole meal with or without any side dish.\n\nChuanr (Chinese :串儿 Чўанр, pinyin: chuànr (shortened from \"chuan er\"); \"\"kebab\"\"), originating in the Xinjiang (新疆) province of China and in recent years has been disseminated throughout the rest of that country, most notably in Beijing. It is a product of the Chinese Islamic cuisine of the Uyghur (维吾尔) people and other Chinese Muslims. Yang rou chuan, or lamb kebabs, is particularly popular.\n\nSuan cai is a traditional fermented vegetable dish, similar to Korean kimchi and German sauerkraut, used in a variety of ways. It consists of pickled Chinese cabbage. Suan cai is a unique form of pao cai due to the material used and the method of production. Although \"suan cai\" is not exclusive to Chinese Islamic cuisine, it is used in Chinese Islamic cuisine to top off noodle soups, especially beef noodle soup.\n\n\"Nang\" 馕 Нәң, is a type of round unleavened bread, topped with sesame. It is similar to South and Central Asia naan.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6182", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6182", "title": "Cantonese cuisine", "text": "Cantonese cuisine\n\nCantonese cuisine (廣東菜), also known as Yue cuisine or Guangdong cuisine, refers to the cuisine of China's Guangdong Province, particularly the provincial capital, Guangzhou (Canton). It is one of the Eight Culinary Traditions of Chinese cuisine. Its prominence outside China is due to the large number of emigrants from Guangdong. Chefs trained in Cantonese cuisine are highly sought after throughout China. When Westerners speak of Chinese food, they usually refer to Cantonese cuisine.\n\nGuangzhou (Canton), the capital of Guangdong Province, has long been a trading port and many imported foods and ingredients are used in Cantonese cuisine. Besides pork, beef and chicken, Cantonese cuisine incorporates almost all edible meats, including offal, chicken feet, duck's tongue, snake and snail. However, lamb and goat are rarely eaten, unlike in the cuisines of northern or western China. Many cooking methods are used, with steaming and stir frying being the most favoured due to their convenience and rapidity. Other techniques include shallow frying, double steaming, braising and deep frying.\n\nFor many traditional Cantonese cooks, the flavours of a dish should be well balanced and not greasy. Apart from that, spices should be used in modest amounts to avoid overwhelming the flavours of the primary ingredients, and these ingredients in turn should be at the peak of their freshness and quality. There is no widespread use of fresh herbs in Cantonese cooking, in contrast with their liberal use in other cuisines such as Sichuan, European, Thai or Vietnamese. Garlic chives and coriander leaves are notable exceptions, although the latter are usually used as mere garnish in most dishes.\n\nIn Cantonese cuisine, a number of ingredients such as spring onion, sugar, salt, soy sauce, rice wine, cornstarch, vinegar, scallion oil, and sesame oil, suffice to enhance flavour, although garlic is heavily used in some dishes, especially those in which internal organs, such as entrails, may emit unpleasant odours. Ginger, chili peppers, five-spice powder, powdered black pepper, star anise and a few other spices are also used, but often sparingly.\n\nAlthough Cantonese cooks pay much attention to the freshness of their primary ingredients, Cantonese cuisine also uses a long list of preserved food items to add flavour to a dish. This may be influenced by Hakka cuisine, since the Hakkas were once a dominant group occupying imperial Hong Kong and other southern territories.\n\nSome items gain very intense flavours during the drying/preservation/oxidation process and some foods are preserved to increase their shelf life. Some chefs combine both dried and fresh varieties of the same items in a dish. Dried items are usually soaked in water to rehydrate before cooking. These ingredients are generally not served \"a la carte\", but rather with vegetables or other Cantonese dishes.\n\nA number of dishes have been part of Cantonese cuisine since the earliest territorial establishments of Guangdong. While many of these are on the menus of typical Cantonese restaurants, some simpler ones are more commonly found in Cantonese homes. Home-made Cantonese dishes are usually served with plain white rice.\n\nThere are a small number of deep-fried dishes in Cantonese cuisine, which can often be found as street food. They have been extensively documented in colonial Hong Kong records of the 19th and 20th centuries. A few are synonymous with Cantonese breakfast and lunch, even though these are also part of other cuisines.\n\nOld fire soup, or \"lou fo tong\" (), is a clear broth prepared by simmering meat and other ingredients over a low heat for several hours. Chinese herbs are often used as ingredients. There are basically two ways to make old fire soup – put ingredients and water in the pot and heat it directly on fire, which is called \"bou tong\" (); or put the ingredients in a small stew pot, and put it in a bigger pot filled with water, then heat the bigger pot on fire directly, which is called \"dun tong\" (). The latter way can keep the most original taste of the soup. \n\nSoup chain stores or delivery outlets in cities with significant Cantonese populations, such as Hong Kong, serve this dish due to the long preparation time required of slow-simmered soup.\n\nDue to Guangdong Province's location on the southern coast of China, fresh seafood is prominent in Cantonese cuisine, and many Cantonese restaurants keep aquariums or seafood tanks on the premises. In Cantonese cuisine, as in cuisines from other parts of Asia, if seafood has a repugnant odour, strong spices are added; the freshest seafood is odourless and, in Cantonese culinary arts, is best cooked by steaming. For instance, in some recipes, only a small amount of soy sauce, ginger and spring onion is added to steamed fish. In Cantonese cuisine, the light seasoning is used only to bring out the natural sweetness of the seafood. As a rule of thumb, the spiciness of a dish is usually inversely proportionate to the freshness of the ingredients.\n\nNoodles are served either in soup broth or fried. These are available as home-cooked meals, on dim sum side menus, or as street food at dai pai dongs, where they can be served with a variety of toppings such as fish balls, beef balls, or fish slices.\n\n\"Siu mei\" () is essentially the Chinese rotisserie style of cooking. Unlike most other Cantonese dishes, \"siu mei\" consists of meat only, with no vegetables.\n\nLou mei () is the name given to dishes made from internal organs, entrails and other left-over parts of animals. It is widely available in southern Chinese regions.\n\nAll Cantonese-style cooked meats, including siu mei, lou mei and preserved meat can be classified as siu laap (). \"Siu laap\" also includes dishes such as:\n\nA typical dish may consist of offal and half an order of multiple varieties of roasted meat. The majority of siu laap is white meat.\n\nLittle pot rice () are dishes cooked and served in a flat-bottomed pot (as opposed to a round-bottomed wok). Usually this is a saucepan or braising pan (see clay pot cooking). Such dishes are cooked by covering and steaming, making the rice and ingredients very hot and soft. Usually the ingredients are layered on top of the rice with little or no mixing in between. Many standard combinations exist.\n\nA number of dishes are traditionally served in Cantonese restaurants only at dinner time. Dim sum restaurants stop serving bamboo-basket dishes after the yum cha period (equivalent to afternoon tea) and begin offering an entirely different menu in the evening. Some dishes are standard while others are regional. Some are customised for special purposes such as Chinese marriages or banquets. Salt and pepper dishes are one of the few spicy dishes.\n\nAfter the evening meal, most Cantonese restaurants offer \"tong sui\" (), a sweet soup. Many varieties of \"tong sui\" are also found in other Chinese cuisines. Some desserts are traditional, while others are recent innovations. The more expensive restaurants usually offer their specialty desserts.\n\nCertain Cantonese delicacies consist of parts taken from rare or endangered animals, which raises controversy over animal rights and environmental issues. This is often due to alleged health benefits of certain animal products. For example, the continued spreading of the idea that shark cartilage can cure cancer has led to decreased shark populations even though scientific research has found no evidence to support the credibility of shark cartilage as a cancer cure.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6183", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6183", "title": "Teochew cuisine", "text": "Teochew cuisine\n\nTeochew cuisine, also known as Chiuchow cuisine, Chaozhou cuisine or Chaoshan cuisine, originated from the Chaoshan region in the eastern part of China's Guangdong Province, which includes the cities of Chaozhou, Shantou and Jieyang. Teochew cuisine bears more similarities to that of Fujian cuisine, with which it shares some dishes. This may be due to the similarity of Chaoshan's and Fujian's culture and language and to their geographic proximity. However, Teochew cuisine is also influenced by Cantonese cuisine in its style and technique.\n\nTeochew cuisine is well known for its seafood and vegetarian dishes. Its use of flavouring is much less heavy-handed than most other Chinese cuisines and depends much on the freshness and quality of the ingredients for taste and flavour. As a delicate cuisine, oil is not often used in large quantities and there is a relatively heavy emphasis on poaching, steaming and braising, as well as the common Chinese method of stir-frying. Teochew cuisine is also known for serving congee (; or \"mue\"), in addition to steamed rice or noodles with meals. The Teochew \"\" is rather different from the Cantonese counterpart, being very watery with the rice sitting loosely at the bottom of the bowl, while the Cantonese dish is more a thin gruel.\n\nAuthentic Teochew restaurants serve very strong oolong tea called Tieguanyin in very tiny cups before and after the meal. Presented as \"gongfu\" tea, the tea has a thickly bittersweet taste, colloquially known as \"gam gam\" ().\n\nA condiment that is popular in Fujian and Taiwanese cuisine and commonly associated with cuisine of certain Teochew groups is shacha sauce (). It is made from soybean oil, garlic, shallots, chilies, brill fish and dried shrimp. The paste has a savoury and slightly spicy taste. As an ingredient, it has multiple uses: as a base for soups, as a rub for barbecued meats, as a seasoning for stir-fried dishes, or as a component for dipping sauces.\n\nIn addition to soy sauce (widely used in all Chinese cuisines), the Teochew diaspora in Southeast Asia use fish sauce in their cooking. It is used as a flavouring agent in soups and sometimes as a dipping sauce, as in Vietnamese spring rolls.\n\nTeochew chefs often use a special stock called superior broth (). This stock remains on the stove and is continuously replenished. Portrayed in popular media, some Hong Kong chefs allegedly use the same superior broth that is preserved for decades. This stock can as well be seen on Chaozhou TV's cooking programmes.\n\nThere is a notable feast in Teochew cuisine called \"\" (). A myriad of dishes are often served, which include shark fin soup, bird's nest soup, lobster, steamed fish, roasted suckling pig and braised goose.\n\nTeochew chefs take pride in their skills of vegetable carving, and carved vegetables are used as garnishes on cold dishes and on the banquet table.\n\nTeochew cuisine is also known for a late night meal known as \"meh siao\" () or \"daa laang\" () among the Cantonese. Teochew people enjoy eating out close to midnight in restaurants or at roadside food stalls. Some dai pai dong-like eateries stay open till dawn.\n\nUnlike the typical menu selections of many other Chinese cuisines, Teochew restaurant menus often have a dessert section.\n\nMany people of Chaoshan origin, also known as Teochiu or Teochew people, have settled in Hong Kong and places in Southeast Asia like Singapore, Cambodia and Thailand. Influences they bring can be noted in Singaporean cuisine and that of other settlements. A large number of Teochew people have also settled in Taiwan, evident in Taiwanese cuisine. Other notable Teochew diaspora communities are in Vietnam and France. There is also a large diaspora of Teochew people (most were from Southeast Asia) in the United States - particularly in California. There is a Teochew Chinese Association in Paris called L'Amicale des Teochews en France.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6184", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6184", "title": "Co-NP", "text": "Co-NP\n\nIn computational complexity theory, co-NP is a complexity class. A decision problem formula_1 is a member of co-NP if and only if its complement formula_2 is in the complexity class NP. In simple terms, co-NP is the class of problems for which there is a polynomial-time algorithm that can verify \"no\" instances (sometimes called counterexamples) given the appropriate certificate. Equivalently, co-NP is the set of decision problems where the \"no\" instances can be accepted in polynomial time by a non-deterministic Turing machine. \n\nAn example of an NP-complete problem is the subset sum problem: given a finite set of integers, is there a non-empty subset that sums to zero? To give a proof of a \"yes\" instance, one must specify a non-empty subset that does sum to zero. The complementary problem is in co-NP and asks: \"given a finite set of integers, does every non-empty subset have a non-zero sum?\".\n\nP, the class of polynomial time solvable problems, is a subset of both NP and co-NP. P is thought to be a strict subset in both cases (and demonstrably cannot be strict in one case and not strict in the other). NP and co-NP are also thought to be unequal. If so, then no NP-complete problem can be in co-NP and no co-NP-complete problem can be in NP.\n\nThis can be shown as follows. Suppose there exists an NP-complete problem formula_1 that is in co-NP. Since all problems in NP can be reduced to formula_1, it follows that for every problem in NP we can construct a non-deterministic Turing machine that decides its complement in polynomial time, i.e., NP ⊆ co-NP. From this it follows that the set of complements of the problems in NP is a subset of the set of complements of the problems in co-NP, i.e., co-NP ⊆ NP. Thus co-NP = NP. The proof that no co-NP-complete problem can be in NP if NP ≠ co-NP is symmetrical.\n\nIf a problem can be shown to be in both NP and co-NP, that is generally accepted as strong evidence that the problem is probably not NP-complete (since otherwise NP = co-NP).\n\nAn example of a problem that is known to belong to both NP and co-NP is integer factorization: given positive integers \"m\" and \"n\" determine if \"m\" has a factor less than \"n\" and greater than one. Membership in NP is clear; if \"m\" does have such a factor then the factor itself is a certificate. Membership in co-NP is also straightforward: one can just list the prime factors of \"m\", all greater or equal to n, which the verifier can confirm to be valid by multiplication and the AKS primality test. It is presently not known whether there is a polynomial-time algorithm for factorization, equivalently that integer factorization is in P, and hence this example is interesting as one of the most natural problems known to be in NP and coNP but not known to be in P. \n"}
{"id": "6185", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6185", "title": "Chuck Yeager", "text": "Chuck Yeager\n\nCharles Elwood Yeager (; born , 1923), best known as Chuck Yeager, is a former United States Air Force general officer and record-setting test pilot. In 1947, he became the first pilot confirmed to have exceeded the speed of sound in level flight.\n\nYeager's career began in World War II as a private in the United States Army Air Forces. After serving as an aircraft mechanic, in September 1942 he entered enlisted pilot training and upon graduation was promoted to the rank of flight officer (the World War II USAAF equivalent to warrant officer) and became a P-51 fighter pilot.\n\nAfter the war, Yeager became a test pilot of many types of aircraft, including experimental rocket-powered aircraft. As the first human to officially break the sound barrier, on , 1947, he flew the experimental Bell X-1 at Mach 1 at an altitude of (). Scott Crossfield was the first to fly faster than Mach 2 in 1953, and Yeager shortly thereafter set a new record of Mach 2.44.\n\nYeager later commanded fighter squadrons and wings in Germany, and in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War, and in recognition of the outstanding performance ratings of those units he was promoted to brigadier general. Yeager's flying career spans more than 60 years and has taken him to every corner of the globe, including the Soviet Union during the height of the Cold War.\n\nYeager was born , 1923, to farming parents Susie Mae and Albert Hal Yeager in Myra, West Virginia, and graduated from high school in Hamlin, West Virginia, in June 1941. He had two brothers, Roy and Hal, Jr., and two sisters, Doris Ann (accidentally killed at age 2 by 6-year-old Roy playing with a shotgun) and Pansy Lee. His first experience with the military was as a teen at the Citizens Military Training Camp at Fort Benjamin Harrison, Indianapolis, Indiana, during the summers of 1939 and 1940. On , 1945, Yeager married Glennis Dickhouse, and the couple had four children. Glennis died in 1990.\n\nThe name \"Yeager\" () is an Anglicized form of the German name \"Jäger\" or \"Jaeger\" (German: \"hunter\"). He is the cousin of former baseball catcher Steve Yeager.\n\nYeager enlisted as a private in the U.S. Army Air Forces (USAAF) on , 1941, and became an aircraft mechanic at George Air Force Base, Victorville, California. At enlistment, Yeager was not eligible for flight training because of his age and educational background, but the entry of the U.S. into World War II less than three months later prompted the USAAF to alter its recruiting standards. Having unusually sharp vision (a visual acuity rated 20/10), which once enabled him to shoot a deer at , Yeager displayed natural talent as a pilot and was accepted for flight training.\n\nHe received his wings and a promotion to flight officer at Luke Field, Arizona, where he graduated from class 43C on , 1943. Assigned to the 357th Fighter Group at Tonopah, Nevada, he initially trained as a fighter pilot, flying Bell P-39 Airacobras (earning a seven-day grounding order for pruning a tree belonging to a local farmer during a training flight), and shipped overseas with the group on , 1943.\nStationed in the United Kingdom at RAF Leiston, Yeager flew P-51 Mustangs in combat with the 363d Fighter Squadron. He named his aircraft \"Glamorous Glen\" after his girlfriend, Glennis Faye Dickhouse, who became his wife in February 1945. Yeager had gained one victory before he was shot down over France in his first aircraft (P-51B-5-NA s/n 43-6763) on , 1944 during his eighth mission. He escaped to Spain on with the help of the \"Maquis\" (French Resistance) and returned to England on , 1944. During his stay with the \"Maquis\", Yeager assisted the guerrillas in duties that did not involve direct combat; he helped to construct bombs for the group, a skill that he had learned from his father. He was awarded the Bronze Star for helping another airman, who had lost part of his leg during the escape attempt, to cross the Pyrenees.\n\nDespite a regulation prohibiting \"evaders\" (escaped pilots) from flying over enemy territory again, the purpose of which was to prevent a second capture from compromising resistance groups, Yeager was reinstated to flying combat. He had joined another evader, fellow P-51 pilot 1st Lt Fred Glover, in speaking directly to the Supreme Allied Commander, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, on , 1944. With Glover pleading their case, they argued that because the Allies had invaded France and the \"Maquis\" were by then openly fighting the Nazis alongside Allied troops, if Yeager or Glover were shot down again, there was little about those who had previously helped them evade capture that could be revealed to the enemy.\n\nEisenhower, after gaining permission from the War Department to decide the requests, concurred with Yeager and Glover. Yeager later credited his postwar success in the Air Force to this decision, saying that his test pilot career followed naturally from his having been a decorated combat pilot, along with having been an aircraft mechanic before attending pilot school. In part, because of his maintenance background, he also frequently served as a maintenance officer in his flying units.\n\nYeager demonstrated outstanding flying skills and combat leadership. On , 1944, he became the first pilot in his group to make \"ace in a day,\" downing five enemy aircraft in a single mission. Two of these kills were scored without firing a single shot: when he flew into firing position against a Messerschmitt Bf 109, the pilot of the aircraft panicked, breaking to starboard and colliding with his wingman. Yeager later reported both pilots bailed out. He finished the war with 11.5 official victories, including one of the first air-to-air victories over a jet fighter (a German Messerschmitt Me 262).\n\nIn his 1986 memoirs, Yeager recalled with disgust that \"atrocities were committed by both sides\" and went on to recount going on a mission with orders from the Eighth Air Force to \"strafe anything that moved.\" During the mission briefing, he whispered to Major Donald H. Bochkay, \"If we are going to do things like this, we sure as hell better make sure we are on the winning side.\" Yeager further noted, \"I’m certainly not proud of that particular strafing mission against civilians. But it is there, on the record and in my memory.\"\n\nYeager was commissioned a second lieutenant while at Leiston, and was promoted to captain before the end of his tour. He flew his 61st and final mission on , 1945, and returned to the United States in early February. As an evader, he received his choice of assignments and, because his new wife was pregnant, chose Wright Field to be near his home in West Virginia. His high number of flight hours and maintenance experience qualified him to become a functional test pilot of repaired aircraft, which brought him under the command of Colonel Albert Boyd, head of the Aeronautical Systems Flight Test Division.\n\nYeager remained in the Air Force after the war, becoming a test pilot at Muroc Army Air Field (now Edwards Air Force Base), following graduation from Air Materiel Command Flight Performance School (Class 46C). After Bell Aircraft test pilot Chalmers \"Slick\" Goodlin demanded $150,000 ($1.6 million in 2015 dollars) to break the sound \"barrier,\" the USAAF selected Yeager to fly the rocket-powered Bell XS-1 in a NACA program to research high-speed flight.\n\nSuch was the difficulty in this task that the answer to many of the inherent challenges were along the lines of \"Yeager better have paid-up insurance.\" Two nights before the scheduled date for the flight, Yeager broke two ribs when he fell from a horse. He was worried that the injury would remove him from the mission and reported that he went to a civilian doctor in nearby Rosamond, who taped his ribs. Yeager told only his wife, as well as friend and fellow project pilot Jack Ridley, about the accident. On the day of the flight, Yeager was in such pain that he could not seal the X-1's hatch by himself. Ridley rigged up a device, using the end of a broom handle as an extra lever, to allow Yeager to seal the hatch.\n\nYeager broke the sound barrier on , 1947, flying the X-1 at Mach 1.07 at an altitude of (). over the Rogers Dry Lake in the Mojave Desert. Yeager was awarded the MacKay and Collier Trophies in 1948 for his mach-transcending flight, and the Harmon International Trophy in 1954. The X-1 he flew that day was later put on permanent display at the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum.\n\nYeager went on to break many other speed and altitude records. He was also one of the first American pilots to fly a MiG-15, after its pilot, No Kum-sok, defected to South Korea. Returning to Muroc, during the latter half of 1953, Yeager was involved with the USAF team that was working on the X-1A, an aircraft designed to surpass Mach 2 in level flight. That year, he flew a chase aircraft for the civilian pilot Jackie Cochran as she became the first woman to fly faster than sound.\n\nOn , 1953, the U.S. Navy program involving the D-558-II Skyrocket and its pilot, Scott Crossfield, became the first team to reach twice the speed of sound. After they were bested, Ridley and Yeager decided to beat rival Crossfield's speed record in a series of test flights that they dubbed \"Operation NACA Weep.\" Not only did they beat Crossfield, but they did it in time to spoil a celebration planned for the 50th anniversary of flight in which Crossfield was to be called \"the fastest man alive.\"\n\nThe Ridley/Yeager USAF team achieved Mach 2.44 on , 1953. Shortly after reaching Mach 2.44, Yeager lost aerodynamic control of the X-1A due to inertia coupling at about . With the aircraft simultaneously rolling, pitching, and yawing out of the sky, Yeager dropped in 51 seconds before regaining control of the aircraft around . He was able to land the aircraft without further incident. Yeager was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal (DSM) in 1954 for this achievement. Yeager received the DSM in the Army design as the Air Force Distinguished Service Medal was not awarded until 1965.\n\nYeager was foremost a fighter pilot and held several squadron and wing commands. From May 1955 to July 1957 he commanded the F-86H Sabre-equipped 417th Fighter-Bomber Squadron (50th Fighter-Bomber Wing) at Hahn AB, Germany, and Toul-Rosieres Air Base, France; and from 1957 to 1960 the F-100D Super Sabre-equipped 1st Fighter Day Squadron (later, while still under Yeager's command, re-designated the 306th Tactical Fighter Squadron) at George Air Force Base, California, and Morón Air Base, Spain.\n\nNow a full colonel in 1962, after completion of a year's studies at the Air War College, Yeager became the first commandant of the USAF Aerospace Research Pilot School, which produced astronauts for NASA and the USAF, after its redesignation from the USAF Flight Test Pilot School. (Yeager himself had only a high school education, so was not eligible to become an astronaut like those he trained.) Between December 1963 and January 1964, Yeager completed five flights in the NASA M2-F1 lifting body. An accident during a December 1963 test flight in one of the school's NF-104s eventually put an end to his record attempts.\n\nIn 1966 Yeager took command of the 405th Tactical Fighter Wing at Clark Air Base, the Philippines, whose squadrons were deployed on rotational temporary duty (TDY) in South Vietnam and elsewhere in Southeast Asia. There he accrued another 414 hours of combat time in 127 missions, mostly in a Martin B-57 Canberra light bomber. In February 1968, Yeager was assigned command of the 4th Tactical Fighter Wing at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, North Carolina, and led the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II wing in South Korea during the \"Pueblo\" crisis.\n\nOn , 1969, Yeager was promoted to brigadier general, and was assigned in July as the vice-commander of the Seventeenth Air Force.\n\nFrom 1971 to 1973, at the behest of Ambassador Joe Farland, Yeager was assigned to Pakistan to advise the Pakistan Air Force.\n\nOn , 1975, following assignments in Germany and Pakistan, Yeager retired from the Air Force at Norton Air Force Base after serving over 33 years on active duty, although he continued to occasionally fly for the USAF and NASA as a consulting test pilot at Edwards AFB.\n\nYeager made a cameo appearance in the movie \"The Right Stuff\" (1983). He played \"Fred,\" a bartender at \"Pancho's Place\", which was most appropriate, as Yeager said, \"if all the hours were ever totaled, I reckon I spent more time at her place than in a cockpit over those years.\" His own role in the movie was played by Sam Shepard, who received an Academy Award nomination for his performance.\n\nFor several years in the 1980s, Yeager was connected to General Motors, publicizing AC Delco, the company's automotive parts division. In 1986 he was invited to drive the Chevrolet Corvette pace car for the 70th running of the Indianapolis 500. In 1988, Yeager was again invited to drive the pace car, this time at the wheel of an Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme. In 1986, President Reagan appointed Yeager to the Rogers Commission that investigated the explosion of the Space Shuttle \"Challenger\".\n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, Yeager set several light general aircraft performance records for speed, range, and endurance. Most notable were flights conducted on behalf of Piper Aircraft. On one such flight, Yeager performed an emergency landing as a result of fuel exhaustion. On another, he piloted Piper's turboprop Cheyenne 400LS to a time-to-height record: FL350 (35,000 feet) in 16 minutes, exceeding the climb performance of a Boeing 737 at gross weight.\n\nDuring this time Yeager also served as a technical adviser for three Electronic Arts flight simulator video games. The games include \"Chuck Yeager's Advanced Flight Trainer\", \"Chuck Yeager's Advanced Flight Trainer 2.0\", and \"Chuck Yeager's Air Combat\". The game manuals featured quotes and anecdotes from Yeager, and were well received by players. Missions featured several of Yeager's accomplishments and let players attempt to top his records. \"Chuck Yeager's Advanced Flight Trainer\" was Electronic Art's top selling game for 1987.\n\nIn 2009, Yeager participated in the documentary \"The Legend of Pancho Barnes and the Happy Bottom Riding Club\", a profile of his friend Pancho Barnes. The documentary was screened at film festivals, aired on public television in the United States and won an Emmy award.\n\nYeager is fully retired from military test flying, after having maintained that status for three decades after his official retirement from the Air Force. On , 1997, on the 50th anniversary of his historic flight past Mach 1, he flew a new \"Glamorous Glennis III\", an F-15D Eagle, past Mach 1. The chase plane for the flight was an F-16 Fighting Falcon piloted by Bob Hoover, an air-show pilot who had been Yeager's wingman for the first supersonic flight. This was Yeager's last official flight with the U.S. Air Force. At the end of his speech to the crowd, Yeager concluded, \"All that I am ... I owe to the Air Force.\" Later that month, he was the recipient of the Tony Jannus Award for his achievements.\n\nOn , 2012, on the 65th anniversary of breaking the sound barrier, Yeager did it again at the age of 89, riding in a McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle piloted by Captain David Vincent out of Nellis Air Force Base.\n\nIn 1973, Yeager was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame, arguably aviation's highest honor. In December 1975, the U.S. Congress awarded Yeager a silver medal \"equivalent to a noncombat Medal of Honor ... for contributing immeasurably to aerospace science by risking his life in piloting the XS-1 research airplane faster than the speed of sound on , 1947.\" President Gerald Ford presented the medal to Yeager in a ceremony at the White House on , 1976.\n\nYeager, who never attended college and was often modest about his background, is considered by many, including Flying Magazine, the California Hall of Fame, the State of West Virginia, National Aviation Hall of Fame, a few U.S. presidents, and the United States Army Air Force, to be one of the greatest pilots of all time. Despite his lack of higher education, he has been honored in his home state. Marshall University has named its highest academic scholarship, the Society of Yeager Scholars, in his honor. Yeager was also the chairman of Experimental Aircraft Association's Young Eagle Program from 1994-2004, and has been named the program's chairman emeritus.\n\nYeager Airport in Charleston, West Virginia, is named in his honor. The Interstate 64/Interstate 77 bridge over the Kanawha River in Charleston is named in his honor. On , 2006, the state of West Virginia also honored Yeager with a marker along Corridor G (part of U.S. 119) in his home Lincoln County, and also renamed part of the highway the \"Yeager Highway\".\n\nYeager is an honorary board member of the humanitarian organization Wings of Hope. On , 2009, Governor Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver announced that Yeager would be one of 13 California Hall of Fame inductees in The California Museum's yearlong exhibit. The induction ceremony was on , 2009, in Sacramento, California. \"Flying Magazine\" ranked Yeager number 5 on its 2013 list of The 51 Heroes of Aviation; he is the highest-ranked living person on the list.\n\nThe Civil Air Patrol, the volunteer auxiliary of the USAF, awards the Charles E. \"Chuck\" Yeager Award to its Senior Members as part of its Aerospace Education program. The General Chuck Yeager Cadet Squadron (SER-FL-237), associated with the Florida Wing, Civil Air Patrol, and based in Brandon, Florida, is also named in his honor.\n\nYeager named his plane after his wife Glennis as a good-luck charm; \"You're my good-luck charm, hon. Any airplane I name after you always brings me home\". Yeager and Glennis moved to Grass Valley, California, after his retirement from the Air Force in 1975. The couple prospered because of Yeager's best-selling autobiography, speaking engagements and commercial ventures. Glennis Yeager died of ovarian cancer in 1990. They had four children (Susan, Don, Mickey and Sharon).\n\nIn 2000, Yeager met actress Victoria Scott D'Angelo on a hiking trail in Nevada County. The pair started dating shortly thereafter, and married in August 2003. Subsequent to the commencement of their relationship, a bitter dispute arose between Yeager, his children and D'Angelo. The children contended that D'Angelo, 41 years Yeager's junior, had married him for his fortune. Yeager and D'Angelo both denied the charge. Litigation ensued, in which his children accused D'Angelo of \"undue influence\" on Yeager, and Yeager accused his children of diverting hundreds of thousands of dollars from his pension fund. In August 2008, the California Court of Appeal ruled for Yeager, finding that his daughter Susan had breached her duty as trustee.\n\nYeager and Victoria reside in Penn Valley, California, the location of the General Chuck Yeager Foundation, which supports programs that \"teach the ideals by which General Yeager has lived.\" He is noted for his outspoken criticism of the UK, for example on Twitter.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6186", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6186", "title": "Cajun cuisine", "text": "Cajun cuisine\n\nCajun cuisine (, ) is a style of cooking named for the French-speaking Acadian people deported by the British from Acadia in Canada to the Acadiana region of Louisiana. It is what could be called a rustic cuisine; locally available ingredients predominate and preparation is simple.\n\nAn authentic Cajun meal is usually a three-pot affair, with one pot dedicated to the main dish, one dedicated to steamed rice, special made sausages, or some seafood dish, and the third containing whatever vegetable is plentiful or available. Shrimp and pork sausage are staple meats used in a variety of dishes.\n\nThe aromatic vegetables green bell pepper (\"poivron\"), onion, and celery are called the holy trinity by Cajun chefs in Cajun and Louisiana Creole cuisines. Roughly diced and combined in cooking, the method is similar to the use of the \"mirepoix\" in traditional French cuisine which blends roughly diced onion, celery and carrot. Characteristic aromatics for the Creole version may also include parsley, bay leaf, green onions, dried cayenne pepper, and dried black pepper.\n\nAround 1755, Acadians were forced out of their settlements by the British, and as a result, they migrated in 1755 in what was called \"le Grand Dérangement\", eventually settling in Southern Louisiana. Due to the extreme change in climate, Acadians were unable to cook their original dishes. Soon, their former culinary traditions were lost, and so, these other meals developed to become what is now considered classic Cajun cuisine traditions (not to be confused with the more modern concept associated with Prudhomme's style). Up through the 20th century, the meals were not elaborate but instead, rather basic. The public's false perception of \"Cajun\" cuisine was based on Prudhomme's style of Cajun cooking, which was spicy, flavorful, and not true to the classic form of the cuisine. Cajun and Creole label have been mistaken to be the same, but the origins of Creole cooking began in New Orleans, and Cajun cooking came 40 years after the establishment of New Orleans down south on the bayou.\nToday, most restaurants serve dishes that consist of Cajun styles, which Paul Prudhomme dubbed \"Louisiana cooking\". In home-cooking, these individual styles are still kept separate. However, there are fewer and fewer people cooking the classic Cajun dishes that would have been eaten by the original settlers. \n\n\nDeep-frying of turkeys or oven-roasted turduckens entered southern Louisiana cuisine more recently. Also, blackening of fish or chicken and barbecuing of shrimp in the shell are excluded because they were not prepared in traditional Cajun cuisine. Blackening was actually an invention by chef Paul Prudhomme in the 1970s, becoming associated with Cajun cooking, and presented as such by him, but is not a true historical or traditional Cajun cooking process.\n\nThe following is a partial list of ingredients used in Cajun cuisine and some of the staple ingredients of the Acadian food culture.\n\n\nCajun folkways include many ways of preserving meat, some of which are waning due to the availability of refrigeration and mass-produced meat at the grocer. Smoking of meats remains a fairly common practice, but once-common preparations such as turkey or duck confit (preserved in poultry fat, with spices) are now seen even by Acadians as quaint rarities.\n\nGame (and hunting) are still uniformly popular in Acadiana.\n\nThe recent increase of catfish farming in the Mississippi Delta has brought about an increase in its usage in Cajun cuisine in the place of the more traditional wild-caught trout (the saltwater species) and red fish.\n\nSeasonings\n\nThyme, sage, mint, marjoram, savory, and basil are considered sweet herbs. In Colonial times a herbes de Provence would be several sweet herbs tied up in a Muslin.\n\nBlended\n\nCooking bases\n\nThree popular local dishes in Acadiana are noted in the Hank Williams' song \"Jambalaya\", namely \"Jambalaya and-a crawfish pie and filé gumbo\".\n\nBoudin is a type of sausage made from pork, pork liver, rice, garlic, green onions and other spices. It is widely available by the link or pound from butcher shops. Boudin is typically stuffed in a natural casing and has a softer consistency than other, better-known sausage varieties. It is usually served with side dishes such as rice dressing, maque choux or bread. Boudin balls are commonly served in southern Louisiana restaurants and are made by taking the boudin out of the case and frying it in spherical form.\n\nGumbo - High on the list of favorites of Cajun cooking are the soups called gumbos. Contrary to non-Cajun or Continental beliefs, gumbo does not mean simply \"everything in the pot\". Gumbo exemplifies the influence of French, Spanish, African and Native American food cultures on Cajun cuisine. The name originally meant \"okra\", a word brought to the region from western Africa. Okra which can be one of the principal ingredients in gumbo recipes is used as a thickening agent and for its distinct vegetable flavor. Many claim that Gumbo is a \"Cajun\" dish, but Gumbo was established long before the Acadian arrival. Its early existence came via the early French Creole culture In New Orleans, Louisiana, where French, Spanish and Africans frequented and also influenced by later waves of Italian, German and Irish settlers.\n\nA filé gumbo is thickened with dried sassafras leaves after the stew has finished cooking, a practice borrowed from the Choctaw Indians. The backbone of a gumbo is roux of which there are two variations: Cajun, a golden brown roux, and Creole, a dark roux, which is made of flour, toasted until well-browned, and fat or oil. The classic gumbo is made with chicken and the Cajun sausage called andouille, pronounced {ahn-doo-wee}, but the ingredients vary according to what is available.\n\nJambalaya - Another classic Cajun dish is jambalaya. The only certain thing that can be said about a jambalaya is that it contains rice, some sort of meat (such as chicken or beef), seafood (such as shrimp or crawfish) or almost anything else. Usually, however, one will find green peppers, onions, celery, tomatoes and hot chili peppers. Anything else is optional. This is also a great pre-Acadian dish, established by the Spanish in Louisiana.\n\nRice and gravy - Rice and gravy dishes are a staple of Cajun cuisine and is usually a brown gravy based on pan drippings, which are deglazed and simmered with extra seasonings and served over steamed or boiled rice. The dish is traditionally made from cheaper cuts of meat and cooked in a cast iron pot, typically for an extended time period in order to let the tough cuts of meat become tender. Beef, pork, chicken or any of a large variety of game meats are used for its preparation. Popular local varieties include hamburger steak, smothered rabbit, turkey necks, and chicken fricassee.\n\nThe crawfish boil is a celebratory event where Cajuns boil crawfish, potatoes, onions and corn in large pots over propane cookers. Lemons and small muslin bags containing a mixture of bay leaves, mustard seeds, cayenne pepper and other spices, commonly known as \"crab boil\" or \"crawfish boil\" are added to the water for seasoning. The results are then dumped onto large, newspaper-draped tables and in some areas covered in Creole / Cajun spice blends, such as REX, Zatarain's, Louisiana Fish Fry or Tony Chachere's. Also, Cocktail sauce, mayonnaise and hot sauce are sometimes used. The seafood is scooped onto large trays or plates and eaten by hand. During times when crawfish are not abundant, shrimp and crabs are prepared and served in the same manner.\n\nAttendees are encouraged to \"suck the head\" of a crawfish by separating the abdomen of the crustacean and sucking out the abdominal fat/juices.\n\nOften, newcomers to the crawfish boil or those unfamiliar with the traditions are jokingly warned \"not to eat the dead ones\". This comes from the common belief that when live crawfish are boiled, their tails curl beneath themselves, but when dead crawfish are boiled, their tails are straight and limp.\nSeafood boils with crabs and shrimp are also popular.\n\nThe traditional Cajun outdoor food event hosted by a farmer in the rural areas of the Acadiana. Family and friends of the farmer gather to socialize, play games, dance, drink, and have a copious meal consisting of hog and other dishes. Men have the task of slaughtering a hog, cutting it into usable parts, and cooking the main pork dishes while women have the task of making boudin. \n\nSimilar to a family boucherie, the \"cochon de lait\" is a food event that revolves around pork but does not need to be hosted by a farmer. Traditionally, a suckling pig was purchased for the event, but in modern \"cochon de lait\"s, adult pigs are used. Unlike the family boucherie, a hog is not butchered by the hosts and there are generally not as many guests or activities. The host and male guests have the task of roasting the pig (see pig roast) while female guests bring side dishes.\n\nThe traditional Cajun Mardi Gras (see: \"Courir de Mardi Gras\") is a Mardi Gras celebration in rural Cajun Parishes. The tradition originated in the 18th century with the Cajuns of Louisiana, but it was abandoned in the early 20th century because of unwelcome violence associated with the event. In the early 1950s the tradition was revived in Mamou in Evangeline Parish. \n\nThe event revolves around male maskers on horseback who ride into the countryside to collect food ingredients for the party later on. They entertain householders with Cajun music, dancing, and festive antics in return for the ingredients. The preferred ingredient is a live chicken in which the householder throws the chicken to allow the maskers to chase it down (symbolizing a hunt), but other ingredients include rice, sausage, vegetables, or frozen chicken. Unlike other Cajun events, men take no part in cooking the main course for the party, and women prepare the chicken and ingredients for the gumbo. \n\nOnce the festivities begin, the Cajun community members eat and dance to Cajun music until midnight, as the beginning of Lent. \n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6187", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6187", "title": "Cologne", "text": "Cologne\n\nCologne (; , , ) is the largest city in the German federal State of North Rhine-Westphalia and the fourth-largest city in Germany (after Berlin, Hamburg, and Munich). It is located within the Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan region, one of the major European metropolitan areas, and with more than ten million inhabitants, the largest in Germany. Cologne is about 45 km southwest of North Rhine-Westphalia's capital of Dusseldorf and 25 km northwest of Bonn.\n\nCologne is located on both sides of the Rhine River, near Germany's borders with Belgium and the Netherlands. The city's famous Cologne Cathedral (\"Kölner Dom\") is the seat of the Catholic Archbishop of Cologne. The University of Cologne (\"Universität zu Köln\") is one of Europe's oldest and largest universities.\n\nCologne was founded and established in Ubii territory in the 1st century AD as the Roman \"Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium\", from which it gets its name. \"Cologne\", the French version of the city's name, has become standard in English as well. The city functioned as the capital of the Roman province of \"Germania Inferior\" and as the headquarters of the Roman military in the region until occupied by the Franks in 462. During the Middle Ages it flourished on one of the most important major trade routes between east and west in Europe. Cologne was one of the leading members of the Hanseatic League and one of the largest cities north of the Alps in medieval and Renaissance times. Prior to World War II the city had undergone several occupations by the French and also by the British (1918–1926). Cologne was one of the most heavily bombed cities in Germany during World War II, with the Royal Air Force (RAF) dropping of bombs on the city. The bombing reduced the population by 95%, mainly due to evacuation, and destroyed almost the entire city. With the intention of restoring as many historic buildings as possible, the successful postwar rebuilding has resulted in a very mixed and unique cityscape.\n\nCologne is a major cultural centre for the Rhineland; it hosts more than 30 museums and hundreds of galleries. Exhibitions range from local ancient Roman archeological sites to contemporary graphics and sculpture. The Cologne Trade Fair hosts a number of trade shows such as Art Cologne, imm Cologne, Gamescom, and the Photokina.\n\nThe first urban settlement on the grounds of modern-day Cologne was \"Oppidum Ubiorum\", founded in 38 BC by the Ubii, a Cisrhenian Germanic tribe. In 50 AD, the Romans founded Colonia on the Rhine and the city became the provincial capital of Germania Inferior in 85 AD. The city was named \"\"Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium\"\" in 50 AD. Considerable Roman remains can be found in present-day Cologne, especially near the wharf area, where a notable discovery of a 1900-year-old Roman boat was made in late 2007. From 260 to 271 Cologne was the capital of the Gallic Empire under Postumus, Marius, and Victorinus. In 310 under Constantine a bridge was built over the Rhine at Cologne. Roman imperial governors resided in the city and it became one of the most important trade and production centres in the Roman Empire north of the Alps. Cologne is shown on the 4th century Peutinger Map.\n\nMaternus, who was elected as bishop in 313, was the first known bishop of Cologne. The city was the capital of a Roman province until occupied by the Ripuarian Franks in 462. Parts of the original Roman sewers are preserved underneath the city, with the new sewerage system having opened in 1890.\n\nEarly medieval Cologne was part of Austrasia within the Frankish Empire.\nCologne had been the seat of a bishop since the Roman period; under Charlemagne, in 795, bishop Hildebold was promoted to archbishop. In 843, Cologne became a city within the Treaty of Verdun-created East Francia.\n\nIn 953, the archbishops of Cologne first gained noteworthy secular power, when bishop Bruno was appointed as duke by his brother Otto I, King of Germany. In order to weaken the secular nobility, who threatened his power, Otto endowed Bruno and his successors on the bishop's see with the prerogatives of secular princes, thus establishing the Electorate of Cologne, formed by the temporal possessions of the archbishopric and included in the end a strip of territory along the left Bank of the Rhine east of Jülich, as well as the Duchy of Westphalia on the other side of the Rhine, beyond Berg and Mark.\nBy the end of the 12th century, the Archbishop of Cologne was one of the seven electors of the Holy Roman Emperor. Besides being prince elector, he was Arch-chancellor of Italy as well, technically from 1238 and permanently from 1263 until 1803.\n\nFollowing the Battle of Worringen in 1288, Cologne gained its independence from the archbishops and became a Free City. Archbishop Sigfried II von Westerburg was forced into exile in Bonn.\nThe archbishop nevertheless preserved the right of capital punishment. Thus the municipal council (though in strict political opposition towards the archbishop) depended upon him in all matters concerning criminal justice. This included torture, which sentence was only allowed to be handed down by the episcopal judge, the so-called \"Greve\". This legal situation lasted until the French conquest of Cologne.\n\nBesides its economic and political significance Cologne also became an important centre of medieval pilgrimage, when Cologne's Archbishop Rainald of Dassel gave the relics of the Three Wise Men to Cologne's cathedral in 1164 (after they in fact had been captured from Milan). Besides the three magi Cologne preserves the relics of Saint Ursula and Albertus Magnus.\n\nCologne's location on the river Rhine placed it at the intersection of the major trade routes between east and west as well as the main Western Europe trade route, South - North Northern Italy-Flanders. These two trade routes were the basis of Cologne's growth. By 1300 the city population was 50,000-55,000. Cologne was a member of the Hanseatic League in 1475, when Frederick III confirmed the city's imperial immediacy.\n\nThe economic structures of medieval and early modern Cologne were characterised by the city's status as a major harbour and transport hub on the Rhine. Craftsmanship was organised by self-administering guilds, some of which were exclusive to women.\n\nAs a free city, Cologne was a sovereign state within the Holy Roman Empire and as such had the right (and obligation) to maintain its own military force. As they wore a red uniform, these troops were known as the \"Rote Funken\" (red sparks). These soldiers were part of the Army of the Holy Roman Empire (\"Reichskontingent\") and fought in the wars of the 17th and 18th century, including the wars against revolutionary France, when the small force was almost completely wiped out in combat. The tradition of these troops is preserved as a military persiflage by Cologne's most outstanding carnival society, the \"Rote Funken\".\n\nThe free city of Cologne must not be confused with the Archbishopric of Cologne which was a state of its own within the Holy Roman Empire. Since the second half of the 16th century the archbishops were drawn from the Bavaria Wittelsbach dynasty. Due to the free status of Cologne, the archbishops were usually not allowed to enter the city. Thus they took up residence in Bonn and later in Brühl on the Rhine. As members of an influential and powerful family, and supported by their outstanding status as electors, the archbishops of Cologne repeatedly challenged and threatened the free status of Cologne during the 17th and 18th centuries, resulting in complicated affairs, which were handled by diplomatic means and propaganda as well as by the supreme courts of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nCologne lost its status as a free city during the French period. According to the Peace Treaty of Lunéville (1801) all the territories of the Holy Roman Empire on the left bank of the Rhine were officially incorporated into the French Republic (which had already occupied Cologne in 1794). Thus this region later became part of Napoleon's Empire. Cologne was part of the French Département Roer (named after the River Roer, German: Rur) with Aachen (French: Aix-la-Chapelle) as its capital. The French modernised public life, for example by introducing the Napoleonic code and removing the old elites from power. The Napoleonic code remained in use on the left bank of the Rhine until 1900, when a unified civil code (the \"Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch\") was introduced in the German Empire. In 1815 at the Congress of Vienna, Cologne was made part of the Kingdom of Prussia, first in the Jülich-Cleves-Berg province and then the Rhine province.\n\nThe permanent tensions between the Roman Catholic Rhineland and the overwhelmingly Protestant Prussian state repeatedly escalated with Cologne being in the focus of the conflict. In 1837 the archbishop of Cologne, Clemens August von Droste-Vischering, was arrested and imprisoned for two years after a dispute over the legal status of marriages between Protestants and Roman Catholics (\"Mischehenstreit\"). In 1874, during the Kulturkampf, Archbishop Paul Melchers was imprisoned before taking refuge in the Netherlands. These conflicts alienated the Catholic population from Berlin and contributed to a deeply felt anti-Prussian resentment, which was still significant after World War II, when the former mayor of Cologne, Konrad Adenauer, became the first West German chancellor.\n\nDuring the 19th and 20th centuries, Cologne absorbed numerous surrounding towns, and by World War I had already grown to 700,000 inhabitants. Industrialisation changed the city and spurred its growth. Vehicle and engine manufacturing were especially successful, though heavy industry was less ubiquitous than in the Ruhr area. The cathedral, started in 1248 but abandoned around 1560, was eventually finished in 1880 not just as a place of worship but also as a German national monument celebrating the newly founded German empire and the continuity of the German nation since the Middle Ages. Some of this urban growth occurred at the expense of the city's historic heritage with much being demolished (for example, the city walls or the area around the cathedral) and sometimes replaced by contemporary buildings.\n\nCologne was designated as one of the Fortresses of the German Confederation. It was turned into a heavily armed fortress (opposing the French and Belgian fortresses of Verdun and Liège) with two fortified belts surrounding the city, the remains of which can be seen to this day. The military demands on what became Germany's largest fortress presented a significant obstacle to urban development, with forts, bunkers, and wide defensive dugouts completely encircling the city and preventing expansion; this resulted in a very densely built-up area within the city itself.\n\nDuring World War I Cologne was the target of several minor air raids, but suffered no significant damage. Cologne was occupied by the British Army of the Rhine until 1926, under the terms of the Armistice and the subsequent Versailles Peace Treaty.\nIn contrast with the harsh behaviour of the French occupation troops in Germany, the British forces were more lenient to the local population. Konrad Adenauer, the mayor of Cologne from 1917 until 1933 and later a West German chancellor, acknowledged the political impact of this approach, especially since Britain had opposed French demands for a permanent Allied occupation of the entire Rhineland.\n\nAs part of the demilitarisation of the Rhineland, the city's fortifications had to be dismantled. This was an opportunity to create two green belts (\"Grüngürtel\") around the city by converting the fortifications and their fields of fire into large public parks. This was not completed until 1933. In 1919 the University of Cologne, closed by the French in 1798, was reopened. This was considered to be a replacement for the loss of the University of Strasbourg on the west bank of the Rhine, which reverted to France with the rest of Alsace. Cologne prospered during the Weimar Republic (1919–33), and progress was made especially in public governance, city planning, housing and social affairs. Social housing projects were considered exemplary and were copied by other German cities. Cologne competed to host the Olympics, and a modern sports stadium was erected at Müngersdorf. When the British occupation ended, the prohibition of civil aviation was lifted and Cologne Butzweilerhof Airport soon became a hub for national and international air traffic, second in Germany only to Berlin Tempelhof Airport.\n\nThe democratic parties lost the local elections in Cologne in March 1933 to the Nazi Party and other right wing parties. The Nazis then arrested the Communist and Social Democrats members of the city assembly, and Mayor Adenauer was dismissed. Compared to some other major cities, however, the Nazis never gained decisive support in Cologne. (Significantly, the number of votes cast for the Nazi Party in Reichstag elections had always been the national average.) By 1939 the population had risen to 772,221 inhabitants.\n\nDuring World War II, Cologne was a Military Area Command Headquarters (\"Militärbereichshauptkommandoquartier\") for the Military District (\"Wehrkreis\") VI of Münster. Cologne was under the command of Lieutenant-General Freiherr Roeder von Diersburg, who was responsible for military operations in Bonn, Siegburg, Aachen, Jülich, Düren, and Monschau. Cologne was home to the 211th Infantry Regiment and the 26th Artillery Regiment.\n\nDuring the Bombing of Cologne in World War II, Cologne endured 262 air raids by the Western Allies, which caused approximately 20,000 civilian casualties and almost completely wiped out the central part of the city. During the night of 31 May 1942, Cologne was the target of \"Operation Millennium\", the first 1,000 bomber raid by the Royal Air Force in World War II. 1,046 heavy bombers attacked their target with 1,455 tons of explosives, approximately two-thirds of which were incendiary. This raid lasted about 75 minutes, destroyed of built-up area, killed 486 civilians and made 59,000 people homeless.\n\nCologne was taken by the American First Army in early March, 1945. By the end of the war, the population of Cologne had been reduced by 95 per cent. This loss was mainly caused by a massive evacuation of the people to more rural areas. The same happened in many other German cities in the last two years of war. By the end of 1945, however, the population had already recovered to approximately 500,000.\n\nBy the end of the war, essentially all of Cologne's pre-war Jewish population of 11,000 had been deported or killed by the Nazis. The six synagogues of the city were destroyed. The synagogue on Roonstraße was rebuilt in 1959.\n\nDespite Cologne's status as the largest city in the region, nearby Düsseldorf was chosen as the political capital of the federated state of North Rhine-Westphalia. With Bonn being chosen as the provisional federal capital (\"provisorische Bundeshauptstadt\") and seat of the government of the Federal Republic of Germany (then informally West Germany), Cologne benefited by being sandwiched between two important political centres. The city became–and still is–home to a number of federal agencies and organizations. After reunification in 1990, Berlin was made the capital of Germany.\n\nIn 1945 architect and urban planner Rudolf Schwarz called Cologne the \"world's greatest heap of rubble\". Schwarz designed the master plan for reconstruction in 1947, which included the construction of several new thoroughfares through the city centre, especially the \"Nord-Süd-Fahrt\" (\"North-South-Drive\"). The master plan took into consideration the fact that even shortly after the war a large increase in automobile traffic could be anticipated. Plans for new roads had already, to a certain degree, evolved under the Nazi administration, but the actual construction became easier when most of the city centre was in ruins.\n\nThe destruction of 95% of the city centre, including the famous Twelve Romanesque churches such as St. Gereon, Great St. Martin, St. Maria im Kapitol and several other monuments in World War II, meant a tremendous loss of cultural treasures. The rebuilding of those churches and other landmarks such as the Gürzenich event hall was not undisputed among leading architects and art historians at that time, but in most cases, civil intention prevailed. The reconstruction lasted until the 1990s, when the Romanesque church of St. Kunibert was finished.\n\nIn 1959, the city's population reached pre-war numbers again. It then grew steadily, exceeding 1 million for about one year from 1975. It remained just below that until mid-2010, when it exceeded 1 million again.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s Cologne's economy prospered for two main reasons. The first was the growth in the number of media companies, both in the private and public sectors; they are especially catered for in the newly developed Media Park, which creates a strongly visual focal point in Cologne city centre and includes the \"KölnTurm\", one of Cologne's most prominent high-rise buildings. The second was the permanent improvement of the diverse traffic infrastructure, which made Cologne one of the most easily accessible metropolitan areas in Central Europe.\n\nDue to the economic success of the Cologne Trade Fair, the city arranged a large extension to the fair site in 2005. At the same time the original buildings, which date back to the 1920s, were rented out to RTL, Germany's largest private broadcaster, as their new corporate headquarters.\n\nCologne was the focus of the 2015 New Year's Eve sexual assaults, with over 500 women reporting that they were sexually assaulted by persons of African and Arab appearance.\n\nThe metropolitan area encompasses over , extending around a central point that lies at 50° 56' 33 latitude and 6° 57' 32 longitude. The city's highest point is above sea level (the Monte Troodelöh) and its lowest point is above sea level (the Worringer Bruch). The city of Cologne lies within the larger area of the Cologne Lowland, a cone-shaped area of southeastern Westphalia that lies between Bonn, Aachen and Düsseldorf.\n\nCologne is divided into 9 boroughs (\"Stadtbezirke\") and 85 districts (\"Stadtteile\"):\n\nCologne is one of the warmest cities in Germany. It has a temperate–oceanic climate with cool winters and warm summers. It is also one of the cloudiest cities in Germany, with just 1568 hours of sun a year. Its average annual temperature is : during the day and at night. In January, the mean temperature is , while the mean temperature in July is . Temperatures can vary significantly over the course of a month with warmer and colder weather. Precipitation is spread evenly throughout the year with a light peak in summer due to showers and thunderstorms.\n\nCologne is regularly affected by flooding from the Rhine and is considered the most flood-prone European city. A city agency (\"Stadtentwässerungsbetriebe Köln\", \"Cologne Urban Drainage Operations\") manages an extensive flood control system which includes both permanent and mobile flood walls, protection from rising waters for buildings close to the river banks, monitoring and forecasting systems, pumping stations and programmes to create or protect floodplains, and river embankments. The system was redesigned after a 1993 flood, which resulted in heavy damage.\n\nIn the Roman Empire the city was large and rich with a population of 40,000 in 100–200 AD. The city was home to around 20,000 people in 1000 AD, growing to 50,000 in 1200 AD. The Rhineland metropolis still had 50,000 residents in 1300 AD.\n\nCologne is the fourth-largest city in Germany in terms of inhabitants after Berlin, Hamburg and Munich. As of 30 June 2011, there were officially 1,010,269 residents. Cologne is the core city of the Cologne/Bonn Region with around 3 million inhabitants (including the neighbouring cities of Bonn, Hürth, Leverkusen, and Bergisch Gladbach).\n\nAccording to local statistics, in 2006 the population density in the city was 2,528 inhabitants per square kilometre. 31.4 per cent of the population had migrated there, and 17.2 per cent of Cologne's population was non-German. The largest group, comprising 6.3 per cent of the total population, was Turkish. As of September 2007, there were about 120,000 Muslims living in Cologne, mostly of Turkish origin. In May 2011 calculations based on census data for 21 countries of origin resulted in the number of about 112,900 Muslim migrants in Cologne, making up 11,2 percent of the population. Cologne also has one of the oldest and largest Jewish communities in Germany.\n\nIn the city the age of the population ranged between 15.5% under the age of 18, 67.0% from 18 to 64, and 17.4% who were 65 years of age or older.\n\nThe city's administration is headed by the mayor and the three deputy mayors.\n\nThe long tradition of a free imperial city, which long dominated an exclusively Catholic population and the age-old conflict between the church and the bourgeoisie (and within it between the patricians and craftsmen) has created its own political climate in Cologne. Various interest groups often form networks beyond party boundaries. The resulting web of relationships, with political, economic, and cultural links with each other in a system of mutual favours, obligations and dependencies, is called the 'Cologne coterie'. This has often led to an unusual proportional distribution in the city government and degenerated at times into corruption: in 1999, a \"waste scandal\" over kickbacks and illegal campaign contributions came to light, which led not only to the imprisonment of the entrepreneur Hellmut Trienekens, but also to the downfall of almost the entire leadership of the ruling Social Democrats.\n\nThe Lord Mayor of Cologne is Henriette Reker. She received 52.66% of the vote at the municipal election on 17 October 2015 and was appointed on 15 December 2015.\n\nCity Councillors are elected for a five-year term and the Mayor has a six-year term.\n\nThe inner city of Cologne was completely destroyed during World War II. The reconstruction of the city followed the style of the 1950s, while respecting the old layout and naming of the streets. Thus, the city today is characterized by simple and modest post-war buildings, with a few interspersed pre-war buildings which were reconstructed due to their historical importance. Some buildings of the \"Wiederaufbauzeit\" (era of reconstruction), for example the opera house by Wilhelm Riphahn, are nowadays regarded as classics of modern architecture. Nevertheless, the uncompromising style of the Cologne Opera house and other modern buildings has remained controversial.\n\nGreen areas account for over a quarter of Cologne, which is approximately of public green space for every inhabitant.\n\nThe presence of animals in Cologne is generally limited to insects, small rodents, and several species of birds. Pigeons are the most often seen animals in Cologne, although the number of birds is augmented each year by a growing population of feral exotics, most visibly parrots such as the rose-ringed parakeet. The sheltered climate in southeast Northrhine-Westphalia allows these birds to survive through the winter, and in some cases they are displacing native species. The plumage of Cologne's green parrots is highly visible even from a distance, and contrasts starkly with the otherwise muted colours of the cityscape.\n\nCologne had 4.31 million overnight stays booked and 2.38 million arrivals in 2008. The city also has the most pubs per capita in Germany. The city has 70 clubs, \"countless\" bars, restaurants, and pubs.\n\nThe Cologne City Hall (\"Kölner Rathaus\"), founded in the 12th century, is the oldest city hall in Germany still in use. The Renaissance style loggia and tower were added in the 15th century. Other famous buildings include the Gürzenich, Haus Saaleck and the Overstolzenhaus.\n\nOf the once 12 medieval city gates, only the Eigelsteintorburg at Ebertplatz, the Hahnentor at Rudolfplatz and the Severinstorburg at Chlodwigplatz still stand today.\n\n\nSeveral bridges cross the Rhine in Cologne. They are (from South to North): the Cologne Rodenkirchen Bridge, South Bridge (railway), Severin Bridge, Deutz Bridge, Hohenzollern Bridge (railway), Zoo Bridge (\"Zoobrücke\") and Cologne Mülheim Bridge. In particular the iron tied arch Hohenzollern Bridge (\"Hohenzollernbrücke\") is a dominant landmark along the river embankment. A Rhine river crossing of a special kind is provided by the Cologne Cable Car (German: \"Kölner Seilbahn\"), a cableway that runs across the Rhine between the Cologne Zoological Garden in Riehl and the Rheinpark in Deutz.\n\nCologne's tallest structure is the Colonius telecommunication tower at . The observation deck has been closed since 1992. A selection of the tallest buildings in Cologne is listed below. Other tall structures include the Hansahochhaus (designed by architect Jacob Koerfer and completed in 1925—it was at one time Europe's tallest office building), the Kranhaus buildings at Rheinauhafen, and the Messeturm Köln (\"trade fair tower\").\n\nCologne has several museums. The famous Roman-Germanic Museum features art and architecture from the city's distant past; the Museum Ludwig houses one of the most important collections of modern art in Europe, including a Picasso collection matched only by the museums in Barcelona and Paris. The Museum Schnütgen of religious art is partly housed in St. Cecilia, one of Cologne's Twelve Romanesque churches.\nMany art galleries in Cologne enjoy an worldwide reputation like e.g. Galerie Karsten Greve, one of the leading galleries for postwar and contemporary art.\n\nSeveral orchestras are active in the city, among them the Gürzenich Orchestra and the WDR Symphony Orchestra Cologne, both based at the Cologne Philharmonic Orchestra Building. Other orchestras are the Musica Antiqua Köln and the WDR Rundfunkorchester Köln, as well as the Cologne Opera and several choirs, including the WDR Rundfunkchor Köln. Cologne was also an important hotbed for electronic music in the 1950s (Studio für elektronische Musik, Karlheinz Stockhausen) and again from the 1990s onward. The public radio and TV station WDR was involved in promoting musical movements such as Krautrock in the 1970s; the influential Can was formed there in 1968. There are several centres of nightlife, among them the \"Kwartier Latäng\" (the student quarter around the Zülpicher Straße) and the nightclub-studded areas around Hohenzollernring, Friesenplatz and Rudolfplatz.\n\nThe large annual literary festival Lit. Cologne features regional and international authors. The main literary figure connected with Cologne is writer Heinrich Böll, winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature.\n\nCologne is well known for its beer, called Kölsch. Kölsch is also the name of the local dialect. This has led to the common joke of Kölsch being the only language one can drink.\n\nCologne is also famous for Eau de Cologne (German: \"Kölnisch Wasser\"; lit: \"Water of Cologne\"), a perfume created by Italian expatriate Johann Maria Farina at the beginning of the 18th century. During the 18th century this perfume became increasingly popular, was exported all over Europe by the Farina family and \"Farina\" became a household name for \"Eau de Cologne\". In 1803 Wilhelm Mülhens entered into a contract with an unrelated person from Italy named Carlo Francesco Farina who granted him the right to use his family name and Mühlens opened a small factory at Cologne's Glockengasse. In later years, and after various court battles, his grandson Ferdinand Mülhens was forced to abandon the name \"Farina\" for the company and their product. He decided to use the house number given to the factory at Glockengasse during the French occupation in the early 19th century, 4711. Today, original Eau de Cologne is still produced in Cologne by both the Farina family, currently in the eighth generation, and by Mäurer & Wirtz who bought the 4711 brand in 2006.\n\nThe Cologne carnival is one of the largest street festivals in Europe. In Cologne, the carnival season officially starts on 11 November at 11 minutes past 11 a.m. with the proclamation of the new Carnival Season, and continues until Ash Wednesday. However, the so-called \"Tolle Tage\" (crazy days) do not start until \"Weiberfastnacht\" (Women's Carnival) or, in dialect, \"Wieverfastelovend\", the Thursday before Ash Wednesday, which is the beginning of the street carnival. Zülpicher Strasse and its surroundings, Neumarkt square, Heumarkt and all bars and pubs in the city are crowded with people in costumes dancing and drinking in the streets. Hundreds of thousands of visitors flock to Cologne during this time. Generally, around a million people celebrate in the streets on the Thursday before Ash Wednesday.\n\nCologne and Düsseldorf have a \"fierce regional rivalry\", which includes carnival parades, football, and beer. People in Cologne prefer Kölsch while people in Düsseldorf prefer Altbier (\"Alt\"). Waiters and patrons will \"scorn\" and make a \"mockery\" of people who order Alt beer in Cologne or Kölsch in Düsseldorf. The rivalry has been described as a \"love–hate relationship\".\n\n\nThe city was home to the internationally famous Ringfest, and now to the C/o pop festival.<ref name=\"C/o pop\"> </ref>\n\nIn addition, Cologne enjoys a thriving Christmas Market Weihnachtsmarkt presence with several locations in the city.\n\nAs the largest city in the Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan region, Cologne benefits from a large market structure. In competition with Düsseldorf, the economy of Cologne is primarily based on insurance and media industries, while the city is also an important cultural and research centre and home to a number of corporate headquarters.\n\nAmong the largest media companies based in Cologne are Westdeutscher Rundfunk, RTL Television (with subsidiaries), n-tv, Deutschlandradio, Brainpool TV and publishing houses like J. P. Bachem, Taschen, Tandem Verlag, and M. DuMont Schauberg. Several clusters of media, arts and communications agencies, TV production studios, and state agencies work partly with private and government-funded cultural institutions. Among the insurance companies based in Cologne are Central, DEVK, DKV, Generali Deutschland, Gen Re, Gothaer, HDI Gerling and national headquarters of AXA Insurance, Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Group and Zurich Financial Services.\n\nThe German flag carrier Lufthansa and its subsidiary Lufthansa CityLine have their main corporate headquarters in Cologne. The largest employer in Cologne is Ford Europe, which has its European headquarters and a factory in Niehl (Ford-Werke GmbH). Toyota Motorsport GmbH (TMG), Toyota's official motorsports team, responsible for Toyota rally cars, and then Formula One cars, has its headquarters and workshops in Cologne. Other large companies based in Cologne include the REWE Group, TÜV Rheinland, Deutz AG and a number of Kölsch breweries. Cologne has the country's highest density of pubs per capita. The largest three Kölsch breweries are Reissdorf, Gaffel, and Früh.\n\nHistorically, Cologne has always been an important trade city, with land, air, and sea connections. The city has five Rhine ports, the second largest inland port in Germany and one of the largest in Europe. Cologne-Bonn Airport is the second largest freight terminal in Germany. Today, the Cologne trade fair (\"Koelnmesse\") ranks as a major European trade fair location with over 50 trade fairs and other large cultural and sports events. In 2008 Cologne had 4.31 million overnight stays booked and 2.38 million arrivals. Cologne's largest daily newspaper is the \"Kölner Stadt-Anzeiger\".\n\nCologne shows a significant increase in startup companies, especially when considering digital business.\n\nRoad building had been a major issue in the 1920s under the leadership of mayor Konrad Adenauer. The first German limited access road was constructed after 1929 between Cologne and Bonn. Today, this is the Bundesautobahn 555. In 1965, Cologne became the first German city to be fully encircled by a motorway ringroad. Roughly at the same time a city centre bypass (\"Stadtautobahn\") was planned, but only partially put into effect, due to opposition by environmental groups. The completed section became \"Bundesstraße (\"Federal Road\") B 55a\", which begins at the \"Zoobrücke\" (\"Zoo Bridge\") and meets with A 4 and A 3 at the interchange Cologne East. Nevertheless, it is referred to as \"Stadtautobahn\" by most locals. In contrast to this the \"Nord-Süd-Fahrt\" (\"North-South-Drive\") was actually completed, a new four/six-lane city centre through-route, which had already been anticipated by planners such as Fritz Schumacher in the 1920s. The last section south of \"Ebertplatz\" was completed in 1972.\n\nIn 2005, the first stretch of an eight-lane motorway in North Rhine-Westphalia was opened to traffic on Bundesautobahn 3, part of the eastern section of the Cologne Beltway between the interchanges Cologne East and Heumar.\n\nCompared to other German cities, Cologne has a traffic layout that is not very bicycle-friendly. It has repeatedly ranked among the worst in an independent evaluation conducted by the Allgemeiner Deutscher Fahrrad-Club. In 2014 it ranked 36th out of 39 German cities with a population greater than 200,000.\n\nCologne has a railway service with Deutsche Bahn InterCity and ICE-trains stopping at \"Köln Hauptbahnhof\" (Cologne Main Station), \"Köln Messe/Deutz\" and \"Cologne/Bonn Airport\". ICE and TGV Thalys high-speed trains link Cologne with Amsterdam, Brussels (in 1h47, 9 departures/day) and Paris (in 3h14, 6 departures/day). There are frequent ICE trains to other German cities, including Frankfurt am Main and Berlin. ICE Trains to London via the Channel Tunnel were planned for 2013.\n\nThe Cologne Stadtbahn operated by Kölner Verkehrsbetriebe (KVB) is an extensive light rail system that is partially underground and serves Cologne and a number of neighbouring cities. It evolved from the tram system. Nearby Bonn is linked by both the Stadtbahn and main line railway trains, and occasional recreational boats on the Rhine. Düsseldorf is also linked by S-Bahn trains, which are operated by Deutsche Bahn.\n\nThere are also frequent buses covering most of the city and surrounding suburbs, and Eurolines coaches to London via Brussels.\n\n\"Häfen und Güterverkehr Köln\" (Ports and Goods traffic Cologne, HGK) is one of the largest operators of inland ports in Germany. Ports include Köln-Deutz, Köln-Godorf, and Köln-Niehl I and II.\n\nCologne's international airport is Cologne/Bonn Airport (CGN). It is also called Konrad Adenauer Airport after Germany's first post-war Chancellor Konrad Adenauer, who was born in the city and was mayor of Cologne from 1917 until 1933. The airport is shared with the neighbouring city of Bonn. Cologne is headquarters to the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). The airport is also the main hub of the airline Germanwings.\n\nCologne is home to numerous universities and colleges, and host to some 72,000 students. Its oldest university, the University of Cologne (founded in 1388) is the largest university in Germany, as the Cologne University of Applied Sciences is the largest university of Applied Sciences in the country. The Cologne University of Music and Dance is the largest conservatory in Europe. Foreigners can have German lessons in the VHS (Adult Education Centre).\nWithin Germany, Cologne is known as an important media centre. Several radio and television stations, including Westdeutscher Rundfunk (WDR), RTL and VOX, have their headquarters in the city. Film and TV production is also important. The city is \"Germany's capital of TV crime stories\". A third of all German TV productions are made in the Cologne region. Furthermore, the city hosts the Cologne Comedy Festival, which is considered to be the largest comedy festival in mainland Europe.\n\nCologne hosts 1. FC Köln, who play in the Bundesliga. They play their home matches in RheinEnergieStadion which also hosted 5 matches of the 2006 FIFA World Cup. The International Olympic Committee and Internationale Vereinigung Sport- und Freizeiteinrichtungen e.V. gave RheinEnergieStadion a bronze medal for \"being one of the best sporting venues in the world\". Cologne also hosts FC Viktoria Köln 1904 and SC Fortuna Köln, who play in the Regionalliga West (fourth division) respectively the 3. Liga (third division).\n\nThe city is also home of the ice hockey team Kölner Haie, in the highest ice hockey league in Germany, the Deutsche Eishockey Liga. They are based at Lanxess Arena.\n\nSeveral horse races per year are held at Cologne-Weidenpesch Racecourse since 1897, the annual Cologne Marathon was started in 1997. From 2002 to 2009, the Panasonic Toyota Racing Formula One team was based in the Marsdorf suburb, at the Toyota Motorsport GmbH facility.\n\nCologne is considered \"the secret golf capital of Germany\". The first golf club in North Rhine-Westphalia was founded in Cologne in 1906. The city offers the most options and top events in Germany.\n\nThe city has hosted several athletic events which includes the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup, 2006 FIFA World Cup, 2007 World Men's Handball Championship, 2010 and 2017 Ice Hockey World Championships and 2010 Gay Games.\n\nNotable people, whose roots can be found in Cologne:\n\nCologne is twinned with:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6188", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6188", "title": "Buddhist cuisine", "text": "Buddhist cuisine\n\nBuddhist cuisine is an East Asian cuisine which is followed by monks and many believers from areas historically influenced by Chinese Buddhism. It is vegetarian or vegan, and it is based on the Dharmic concept of ahimsa (non-violence). Vegetarianism is common in other Dharmic faiths such as Hinduism, Jainism and Sikhism as well as East Asian religions like Taoism. While monks are vegetarian year-round, many believers follow the Buddhist vegetarian diet temporarily, similar to Christian Lent.\n\nVegetarian cuisine is known as \"sùshí\" (素食) (\"vegetarian food\"), \"chúnsù\" (纯素) (\"vegan\"), \"zhāicài\" (斋菜) (\"lent / fasting food\") in China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore and Taiwan; \"đồ chay\" in Vietnam; in Japan; \"sachal eumsik\" (\"temple food\") in Korea; \"jay (เจ)\" in Thailand and by other names in many countries. The dishes that comprise Buddhist cuisine in any given place will be influenced by the style of food there.\n\nThe origin of \"Buddhist food\" as a distinct sub-style of cuisine is tied to monasteries, where one member of the community would have the duty of being the head cook and supplying meals that paid respect to the strictures of Buddhist precepts. Temples that were open to visitors from the general public might also serve meals to them and a few temples effectively run functioning restaurants on the premises. In Japan, this practice is generally known as , and served at many temples, especially in Kyoto. A more recent version, more Chinese in style, is prepared by the Ōbaku school of zen, and known as ; this is served at the head temple of Manpuku-ji, as well as various subtemples. In modern times, commercial restaurants have also latched on to the style, catering both to practicing and non-practicing lay people.\n\nMost of the dishes considered to be uniquely Buddhist are vegetarian, but opinions and restrictions on the eating of meat, and whether it should be prohibited, vary among sects.\n\nWhen monks and nuns who follow the Theravadan way feed themselves by alms, they must eat leftover foods which are given to them, including meat. (The Pali/Sanskrit term for monks and nuns means \"one who seeks alms\".) The exception to this alms rule is when monks and nuns have seen, heard or known that animal(s) have been specifically killed to feed the alms-seeker, in which case consumption of such meat would be karmically negative. The same restriction is also followed by lay Buddhists and is known as the consumption of the \"triply clean meat\" (三净肉). Additionally, the Pali Sutras where this rule is set forth tell of the Buddha refuting a suggestion by his student Devadatta to include vegetarianism in the monastic precepts.\n\nIn the Mahayana tradition, by contrast, acceptance of the Pali Sutras is contested and several of the sutras that comprise the Mahayana canon contain several explicit prohibitions against consuming meat, in one case saying \"One who eats meat kills the seed of great compassion\". Japanese Buddhist sects generally believe that Buddha ate meat. All Japanese Kamakura sects of Buddhism (Zen, Nichiren, Jodo) have relaxed Mahayana vinaya, and as a consequence, vegetarianism is optional. Tibetan Buddhism has long accepted that the practical difficulties in obtaining vegetables and grains within most of Tibet make it impossible to insist upon vegetarianism; however, the leading Tibetan Buddhist teachers agree upon the great worth of practising vegetarianism whenever and wherever possible. The monastic community in Chinese Buddhism, Vietnamese Buddhism and most of Korean Buddhism strictly adhere to vegetarianism.\n\nStill, both Mahayana and Theravada Buddhists consider that one may practice vegetarianism as part of cultivating Bodhisattvas's paramita.\n\nEast Asian \"Buddhist\" cuisine differs from Western vegetarian cuisine in one aspect, that is avoidance of killing plant life. Buddhist vinaya for monks and nuns prohibits harming of plants. Therefore, strictly speaking, root vegetables (such as potatoes, carrots or onion and garlic) are not to be used as this results in the death of the plant. The respective Vinaya forbid the monks and nuns the consumption of mango and garlic. Both prohibitions followed incidents in which monastics harvested more than they could eat in one day. This restriction of not eating garlic and mango is found in both the Theravada vinaya and in that of the Mahayana. The monastic has to follow this rule on all occasions, not just on holidays.\n\nIn addition to the ban on garlic practically all Mahayana monastics in China, Japan and Vietnam specifically avoid eating strong-smelling plants, traditionally asafoetida, shallot, mountain leek and Allium chinense, which together with garlic are referred to as \"wǔ hūn\" (五荤, or 'Five Acrid and Strong-smelling Vegetables') or \"wǔ xīn\" (五辛 or 'Five Spices') as they tend to excite senses. This is based on teachings found in the Brahamajala Sutra, the Surangama Sutra and the Lankavatara Sutra (chapter eight). In modern times this rule is often interpreted to include other vegetables of the onion genus, as well as coriander. This food regime follows that of the Taoists who are bent on the life of asceticism. The East-Asian Buddhist rationale is the same as that of the Taoists. This custom also draws parallels with some believers of Hinduism and Jainism who also do not consume pungent tasting foods.\n\nAlcohol and other drugs are also avoided by many Buddhists because of their effects on the mind and \"mindfulness\". It is part of the Five Precepts which dictate that one is not to consume \"addictive materials\". The definition of \"addictive\" depends on each individual but most Buddhists consider alcohol, tobacco and drugs other than medicine to be addictive. Although caffeine is now also known to be addictive, caffeinated drinks and especially tea are not included under this restriction; tea in particular is considered to be healthful and beneficial and its mild stimulant effect desirable. There are many legends about tea. Among meditators it is considered to keep the person alert and awake without overexcitement.\n\nIn theory and practice, many regional styles of cooking may be adopted to be \"Buddhist\" as long as the cook, with the above restrictions in mind, prepares the food, generally in simple preparations, with expert attention to its quality, wholesomeness and flavor. Often working on a tight budget, the monastery cook would have to make the most of whatever ingredients were available.\n\nIn \"Tenzo kyokun\" (\"Instructions for the Zen Cook\"), Soto Zen founder Eihei Dogen wrote the following about the Zen attitude toward food:\n\nIn preparing food, it is essential to be sincere and to respect each ingredient regardless of how coarse or fine it is. (...) A rich buttery soup is not better as such than a broth of wild herbs. In handling and preparing wild herbs, do so as you would the ingredients for a rich feast, wholeheartedly, sincerely, clearly. When you serve the monastic assembly, they and you should taste only the flavour of the Ocean of Reality , the Ocean of unobscured Awake Awareness, not whether or not the soup is creamy or made only of wild herbs. In nourishing the seeds of living in the Way rich food and wild grass are not separate.\"\"\n\nFollowing its dominant status in most parts of East Asia where Buddhism is most practiced, rice features heavily in as a staple in the Buddhist meal, especially in the form of rice porridge or congee as the usual morning meal. Noodles and other grains may often be served as well. Vegetables of all sorts are generally either stir-fried or cooked in broth with seasonings and may be eaten with various sauces. Eggs and dairy are sometimes permitted and may show up on occasion in moderate amounts; dairy is not common in purely Japanese and Chinese preparations but may appear in dishes from American and European monasteries that follow the traditions. Eggs are seen as almost meat and many Buddhists avoid them. Seasonings will be informed by whatever is common in the local region; for example, soy sauce and vegan dashi figure strongly in Japanese monastery food while curry may be prominent in Southeast Asia. Sweets and desserts are not often consumed, but are permitted in moderation and may be served at special occasions such as in the context of a tea ceremony in the Zen tradition.\n\nBuddhist vegetarian chefs have become extremely creative in imitating meat using prepared wheat gluten, also known as seitan, kao fu (烤麸) or wheat meat, soy (such as tofu or tempeh), agar, konnyaku and other plant products. Some of their recipes are the oldest and most-refined meat analogues in the world. Soy and wheat gluten are very versatile materials, because they can be manufactured into various shapes and textures, and they absorb flavorings (including, but not limited to, meat-like flavorings), while having very little flavor of their own. With the proper seasonings, they can mimic various kinds of meat quite closely.\n\nSome of these Buddhist vegetarian chefs are in the many monasteries and temples which serve allium-free and mock-meat (also known as 'meat analogues') dishes to the monks and visitors (including non-Buddhists who often stay for a few hours or days, to Buddhists who are not monks, but staying overnight for anywhere up to weeks or months). Many Buddhist restaurants also serve vegetarian, vegan, non-alcoholic or allium-free dishes.\n\nSome Buddhists eat vegetarian on the 1st and 15th of the lunar calendar (lenten days), on Chinese New Year eve, and on saint and ancestral holy days. To cater to this type of customer, as well as full-time vegetarians, the menu of a Buddhist vegetarian restaurant usually shows no difference from a typical Chinese or East Asian restaurant, except that in recipes originally made to contain meat, a soy chicken substitute might be served instead.\n\nAccording to cookbooks published in English, formal monastery meals in the Zen tradition generally follow a pattern of \"three bowls\" in descending size. The first and largest bowl is a grain-based dish such as rice, noodles or congee; the second contains the protein dish which is often some form of stew or soup; the third and smallest bowl is a vegetable dish or a salad.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6193", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6193", "title": "Constantin von Tischendorf", "text": "Constantin von Tischendorf\n\nLobegott Friedrich Constantin (von) Tischendorf (18 January 1815 – 7 December 1874) was a world leading biblical scholar in his time. In 1844 he discovered the world's oldest and most complete disputed Bible dating from 325, with the complete New Testament not discovered before. This Bible is called Codex Sinaiticus, after the St. Catherine's Monastery at Mt. Sinai, where Tischendorf discovered it. The codex can be seen either in the British Library in London, or as a digitalised version on the Internet. Textual disputes are resolved when the two oldest books, Codex Sinaiticus (source aleph, 4th AD) and Codex Vaticanus (source beta, 4th AD), agree with each other. Tischendorf was made an Honorary Doctor by Oxford University on 16 March 1865, and an Honorary Doctor by Cambridge University on 9 March 1865 following this find of the century. While a student gaining his academic degree in the 1840s, he earned international recognition when he deciphered the \"Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus\", a 5th-century Greek manuscript of the New Testament. \n\nThe \"Codex Sinaiticus\" contains a 4th-century manuscript of New Testament texts. Two other Bibles of similar age exist, though they are less complete: Codex Vaticanus in the Vatican Library and Codex Alexandrinus, currently owned by the British Library. The Codex Sinaiticus is deemed the most authoritative surviving New Testament manuscript, as no older document is available. The content of the \"oldest Bible of the world\" (as it is more complete than Codex Alexandrinus or Codex Vaticanus) has been digitised at Codex Sinaiticus. Experience the oldest Bible\n\nDuring his life Tischendorf was seeking old biblical manuscripts, as he saw it as his task to give theology a Greek New Testament, which was based on the oldest possible scriptures. He intended to be as close as possible to the original References. Tischendorf's greatest discovery was in the monastery Saint Catherine on the Sinai-Peninsula, which he visited in May 1844, and again in 1853 and 1859 (as Russian envoy).\n\nIn 1862 Tischendorf published the text of the Codex Sinaiticus for the 1000th Anniversary of the Russian Monarchy in an illustrious four volume Facsimile edition and in a less costly text edition to enable all scholars access to the Codex.\n\nTischendorf pursued a constant course of editorial labours, mainly on the New Testament, until he was broken down by overwork in 1873. His motive, as explained in a publication on Tischendorfs Letter by Prof. Christfried Boettrich (Leibzig University, Prof. of Theology), was to prove scientifically that the words of the Bible were trustfully transmitted over centuries.\n\nTischendorf was born in Lengenfeld, Saxony, near Plauen, the son of a physician. Beginning in 1834, he spent his scholarly career at the University of Leipzig where he was mainly influenced by JGB Winer, and he began to take special interest in New Testament criticism. Winer's influence gave him the desire to use the oldest manuscripts in order to compile the text of the New Testament as close to the original as possible. In 1838 he took the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, then became master at a school near Leipzig.\n\nAfter a journey through southern Germany and Switzerland, and a visit to Strassburg, he returned to Leipzig, and set to work upon a critical study of the New Testament text. In 1840 he qualified as university lecturer in theology with a dissertation on the recensions of the New Testament text — the main part of which reappeared the following year in the prolegomena to his first edition of the Greek New Testament. His critical apparatus included variant readings from earlier scholars — Elsevier, Georg Christian Knapp, Johann Martin Augustin Scholz, and as recent as Karl Lachmann — whereby his researches were emboldened to depart from the received text as used in churches.\n\nThese early textual studies convinced him of the absolute necessity of new and more exact collations of manuscripts. From October 1840 until January 1843 he was in Paris, busy with the treasures of the Bibliothèque Nationale, eking out his scanty means by making collations for other scholars, and producing for the publisher, Firmin Didot, several editions of the Greek New Testament — one of them exhibiting the form of the text corresponding most closely to the Vulgate. His second edition retracted the more precarious readings of the first, and included a statement of critical principles that is a landmark for evolving critical studies of Biblical texts.\n\nA great triumph of these laborious months was the decipherment of the palimpsest \"Codex Ephraemi Syri Rescriptus\", of which the New Testament part was printed before he left Paris, and the Old Testament in 1845. His success in dealing with a manuscript that, having been over-written with other works of Ephrem the Syrian, had been mostly illegible to earlier collators, made him more well known, and gained support for more extended critical expeditions. He now became \"professor extraordinarius\" at Leipzig, and became married in 1845. He also began to publish \"Reise in den Orient\", an account of his travels in the east (in 2 vols., 1845–46, translated as \"Travels in the East\" in 1847). Even though he was an expert in reading the text of a palimpsest (this is a document where the original writing has been removed and new writing added), he was not able to identify the value or meaning of the \"Archemedes Palimpsest\", which he donated to Cambridge.\n\nFrom Paris, he had paid short visits to the Netherlands (1841) and England (1842). In 1843 he visited Italy, and after a stay of thirteen months, went on to Egypt, Sinai, and the Levant, returning by Vienna and Munich.\n\nIn 1844 Tischendorf travelled the first time to Saint Catherine's Monastery at the foot of Mount Sinai in Egypt, where he found the oldest complete known Bible. Of the many pages which were contained in an old wicker basket (the kind that the monastery hauled in its visitors as customary in unsafe territories) he was given 43 pages as a present. He donated those 43 pages to King Frederick Augustus II of Saxony (reigned 1836-1854), to honour him and to recognise his patronage as the funder of Tischenforf's journey. (Tischendorf held a position as Theological Professor at Leipzig University, also under the patronage of Frederick Augustus II.) Leipzig University put 2 of the leaves on display in 2011.\nTischendorf reported in his 1865 book \"Wann Wurden Unsere Evangelen Verfasst\", translated to English in 1866 as \"When Were Our Gospels Written\" in the section \"The Discovery of the Sinaitic Manuscript\" that he found, in a trash basket, forty-three sheets of parchment of an ancient copy of the Greek Old Testament, reporting that the monks were using the trash to start fires. And Tischendorf, horrified, asked if he could have them. He deposited them at the University of Leipzig, under the title of the \"Codex Friderico-Augustanus\", a name given in honour of his patron, Frederick Augustus II of Saxony, king of Saxony. The fragments were published in 1846, although Tischendorf kept the place of discovery a secret.\n\nMany have expressed skepticism at the historical accuracy of this report of saving a 1500-year-old parchment from the flames Controversy about waste basket. J. Rendel Harris referred to the story as a \"myth\". The Tischendorf Lesebuch (see References) quotes that the Librarian Kyrillos mentioned to Tischendorf that the contents of the basket had already twice been submitted to the fire. The contents of the baskets were damaged scriptures, the third filling apparently, so cited by Tischendorf himself.[see Tischendorf Lesebuch, Tischendorf's own account]. Further to support his statement could be said that the square pages of a very precious document are not generally kept in upright/ unbound storage in a round container as is reported above. Further even in an ancient library books are stored lying on a surface, or for leather bound books standing on a shelf in a row of books, particularly in a library. Further two-thirds of the Old Testament of the Codex Sinaiticus doesn't exist any more (read Codex Sinaiticus link on Wikipedia), and would support that some contents of the basket have been used to lit the flames. The additional page contributed to the British Museum digitalisation in 2004 of the Codex by the monastery stood out particularly by having been cut into a bookmark [also Tischendorf found by his 2nd visit in 1853 a fragment from Genesis as a bookmark in another manuscript](!) - it appears that the Codex Sinaiticus has been saved from the fire, rather than being \"just\" discovered amongst other books.\n\nIn 1853 Tischendorf made a second trip to the Syrian monastery but made no new discoveries. He returned a third time in January 1859 under the patronage of the Tsar Alexander II of Russia with the active aid of the Russian government to find more of the \"Codex Frederico-Augustanus\" or similar ancient Biblical texts. On February 4, the last day of his visit, he was shown a text which he recognized as significant — the \"Codex Sinaiticus\" — a Greek manuscript of the complete New Testament and parts of the Old Testament dating to the 4th century.\n\nTischendorf persuaded the monks to present the manuscript to Tsar Alexander II of Russia, at the cost of the Tsar it was published in 1862 (in four folio volumes). Those ignorant of the details of his discovery of the \"Codex Sinaiticus\" accused Tischendorf of buying manuscripts from ignorant monastery librarians at low prices. Indeed, he was never rich, but he staunchly defended the rights of the monks at Saint Catherine's Monastery when he persuaded them eventually to send the manuscript to the Tsar. This took approximately 10 years because the abbot of St Catherines had to be re-elected and confirmed in office in Cairo and in Jerusalem, and during those 10 years no one in the monastery had the authority to hand over any documents. However the documents were handed over in due course following a signed and sealed letter to the Tsar Alexander II (Schenkungsurkunde). Even so, the monks of Mt. Sinai still display a receipt-letter from Tischendorf promising to return the manuscript to them in the case that the donation can not be done. This token-letter had to be destroyed, following the late issue of a \"Schenkungsurkunde\". This donation act regulated the Codex exchange with the Tsar, against 9000 Rubels and Rumanian estate protection. The Tsar was seen as the protector of Greek-Orthodox Christians. Thought lost since the Russian revolution, the document (Schenkungsurkunde) has now resurfaced in St Petersburg 2003, and has also been long before commented upon by other scholars like Kurt Aland. The monastery has disputed the existence of the gift certificate (Schenkungsurkunde) since the British Library was named as the new owner of the Codex. Now following the late find of the gift certificate by the National Russian Library the existence cannot be disputed in earnest National Russian Library. In 1869 the Tsar awarded Tischendorf the style of \"von\" Tischendorf as a Russian noble. 327 facsimile editions of the Codex were printed in Leipzig for Tsar (instead of a salary for the three-year work of Tischendorf the Tsar gave him 100 copies for reselling) in order to celebrate the 1000th anniversary of the traditional foundation of the Rus' state in 862 with the publication of this most amazing find. Supporting the production of the facsimile, all made with special print characters for each of the 4 scribes of the Codex Sinaiticus, was shift work and contributed to Tischendorf's early demise due to exhausting work for months also during nights. Thus the Codex found its way to the Imperial Library at St. Petersburg.\n\nWhen the 4-volume luxury edition of the Sinai Bible was completed in 1862, C. Tischendorf presented the original ancient manuscript to Emperor Alexander II. Meanwhile, the question of transferring the manuscript to the full possession of the Russian Sovereign remained unresolved for some years. In 1869, the new Archbishop of Sinai, Callistratus, and the monastic community, signed the official certificate presenting the manuscript to the Czar. The Russian Government, in turn, bestowed the Monastery with 9000 rubles and decorated the Archbishop and some of the brethren with orders. In 1933 the Soviet Government sold the Codex Sinaiticus for 100,000 pounds to the British Museum in London, England. The official certificate with signatures in Russian/ French/ Greek sections has been refound in St Petersburg.\n\nIn the winter of 1849 the first edition of his great work now titled \"Novum Testamentum Graece. Ad antiquos testes recensuit. Apparatum criticum multis modis\" appeared (translated as \"Greek New Testament. The ancient witnesses reviewed. Preparations critical in many ways\"), containing canons of criticism, adding examples of their application that are applicable to students today:\n\nBasic rule: \"The text is only to be sought from ancient evidence, and especially from Greek manuscripts, but without neglecting the testimonies of versions and fathers.\"\nThese were partly the result of the tireless travels he had begun in 1839 in search of unread manuscripts of the New Testament, \"to clear up in this way,\" he wrote, \"the history of the sacred text, and to recover if possible the genuine apostolic text which is the foundation of our faith.\"\n\nIn 1850 appeared his edition of the \"Codex Amiatinus\" (in 1854 corrected) and of the Septuagint version of the Old Testament (7th ed., 1887); in 1852, amongst other works, his edition of the \"Codex Claromontanus\".\n\nMeanwhile, also in 1859, he had been made \"professor ordinarius\" of theology and of Biblical paleography, this latter professorship being specially created for him; and another book of travel, \"Aus dem heiligen Lande\", appeared in 1862. Tischendorf's Eastern journeys were rich enough in other discoveries to merit the highest praise.\n\nBesides his fame as a scholar, he was a friend of both Robert Schumann, with whom he corresponded, and Felix Mendelssohn, who dedicated a song to him. His text critical colleague Samuel Prideaux Tregelles wrote warmly of their mutual interest in textual scholarship. His personal library, purchased after his death, eventually came to the University of Glasgow, where a commemorative exhibition of books from his library was held in 1974 and can be accessed by the public.\n\nHe died in Leipzig.\n\nHis \"magnum opus\" was the \"Critical Edition of the New Testament.\"\n\nThe great edition, of which the text and apparatus appeared in 1869 and 1872, was called by himself \"editio viii\"; but this number is raised to twenty or twenty-one, if mere reprints from stereotype plates and the minor editions of his great critical texts are included; posthumous prints bring the total to forty-one. Four main recensions of Tischendorf's text may be distinguished, dating respectively from his editions of 1841, 1849, 1859 (ed. vii), and 1869–72 (ed. viii). The edition of 1849 may be regarded as historically the most important, from the mass of new critical material it used; that of 1859 is distinguished from Tischendorf's other editions by coming nearer to the received text; in the eighth edition, the testimony of the Sinaitic manuscript received great (probably too great) weight. The readings of the Vatican manuscript were given with more exactness and certainty than had been possible in the earlier editions, and the editor had also the advantage of using the published labours of his colleague and friend Samuel Prideaux Tregelles.\n\nOf relatively lesser importance was Tischendorf's work on the Greek Old Testament. His edition of the Roman text, with the variants of the Alexandrian manuscript, the \"Codex Ephraemi\", and the \"Friderico-Augustanus\", was of service when it appeared in 1850, but, being stereotyped, was not greatly improved in subsequent issues. Its imperfections, even within the limited field it covers, may be judged by the aid of Eberhard Nestle's appendix to the 6th issue (1880).\n\nBesides this may be mentioned editions of the New Testament apocrypha, \"De Evangeliorum apocryphorum origine et usu\" (1851); \"Acta Apostolorum apocrypha\" (1851); \"Evangelia apocrypha\" (1853; 2nd ed., 1876); \"Apocalypses apocryphae\" (1866), and various minor writings, partly of an apologetic character, such as \"Wann wurden unsere Evangelien verfasst?\" (\"When Were Our Gospels Written?\"; 1865; 4th ed., 1866, digitized by Google and available for e-readers), \"Haben wir den echten Schrifttext der Evangelisten und Apostel?\" (1873), and \"Synopsis evangelica\" (7th ed., 1898).\n\n\n\n\n\nHis Publications continued:\n\n\nCooperation\n\n\nSecond Author:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6195", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6195", "title": "Calvin Coolidge", "text": "Calvin Coolidge\n\nJohn Calvin Coolidge Jr. (; July 4, 1872 – January 5, 1933) was the 30th President of the United States (1923–29). A Republican lawyer from Vermont, Coolidge worked his way up the ladder of Massachusetts state politics, eventually becoming governor of that state. His response to the Boston Police Strike of 1919 thrust him into the national spotlight and gave him a reputation as a man of decisive action. Soon after, he was elected as the 29th vice president in 1920 and succeeded to the presidency upon the sudden death of Warren G. Harding in 1923. Elected in his own right in 1924, he gained a reputation as a small-government conservative, and also as a man who said very little, although having a rather dry sense of humor. Coolidge is popularly known for the misquotation, \"The business of America is business\".\n\nCoolidge restored public confidence in the White House after the scandals of his predecessor's administration, and left office with considerable popularity. As a Coolidge biographer wrote, \"He embodied the spirit and hopes of the middle class, could interpret their longings and express their opinions. That he did represent the genius of the average is the most convincing proof of his strength.\" Coolidge's retirement was relatively short, as he died at the age of 60 in January 1933, less than two months before his immediate successor, Herbert Hoover, left office.\n\nAlthough his reputation underwent a renaissance during the Reagan administration, modern assessments of Coolidge's presidency are divided. He is adulated among advocates of smaller government and \"laissez-faire\"; supporters of an active central government generally view him less favorably, while both sides praise his stalwart support of racial equality.\n\nJohn Calvin Coolidge Jr. was born in Plymouth Notch, Windsor County, Vermont, on July 4, 1872, the only U.S. president to be born on Independence Day. He was the elder of the two children of John Calvin Coolidge Sr. (1845–1926) and Victoria Josephine Moor (1846–85). Coolidge Senior engaged in many occupations, but developed a statewide reputation as a prosperous farmer, storekeeper and public servant. He held various local offices, including justice of the peace and tax collector and served in the Vermont House of Representatives as well as the Vermont Senate. Coolidge's mother was the daughter of a Plymouth Notch farmer. She was chronically ill and died, perhaps from tuberculosis, when Coolidge was twelve years old. His younger sister, Abigail Grace Coolidge (1875–1890), died at the age of fifteen, probably of appendicitis, when Coolidge was eighteen. Coolidge's father remarried in 1891, to a schoolteacher, and lived to the age of eighty.\n\nCoolidge's family had deep roots in New England; his earliest American ancestor, John Coolidge, emigrated from Cottenham, Cambridgeshire, England, around 1630 and settled in Watertown, Massachusetts. Another ancestor, Edmund Rice, arrived at Watertown in 1638. Coolidge's great-great-grandfather, also named John Coolidge, was an American military officer in the Revolutionary War and one of the first selectmen of the town of Plymouth Notch. His grandfather Calvin Galusha Coolidge served in the Vermont House of Representatives. Many of Coolidge's ancestors were farmers, and numerous distant cousins were prominent in politics.\n\nCoolidge attended Black River Academy and then St. Johnsbury Academy, before enrolling at Amherst College, where he distinguished himself in the debating class, as a senior joined the fraternity Phi Gamma Delta and graduated \"cum laude\". While there, Coolidge was profoundly influenced by philosophy professor Charles Edward Garman, a Congregational mystic, with a neo-Hegelian philosophy.\n\nCoolidge explained Garman's ethics forty years later, \nthere is a standard of righteousness that might does not make right, that the end does not justify the means, and that expediency as a working principle is bound to fail. The only hope of perfecting human relationships is in accordance with the law of service under which men are not so solicitous about what they shall get as they are about what they shall give. Yet people are entitled to the rewards of their industry. What they earn is theirs, no matter how small or how great. But the possession of property carries the obligation to use it in a larger service...\n\nAt his father's urging after graduation, Coolidge moved to Northampton, Massachusetts to become a lawyer. To avoid the cost of law school, Coolidge followed the common practice of apprenticing with a local law firm, Hammond & Field, and reading law with them. John C. Hammond and Henry P. Field, both Amherst graduates, introduced Coolidge to law practice in the county seat of Hampshire County. In 1897, Coolidge was admitted to the Massachusetts bar, becoming a country lawyer. With his savings and a small inheritance from his grandfather, Coolidge opened his own law office in Northampton in 1898. He practiced commercial law, believing that he served his clients best by staying out of court. As his reputation as a hard-working and diligent attorney grew, local banks and other businesses began to retain his services.\n\nIn 1903, Coolidge met Grace Anna Goodhue, a University of Vermont graduate and teacher at Northampton's Clarke School for the Deaf. They married on October 4, 1905 at 2:30 p.m. in a small ceremony which took place in the parlor of Grace's family's house, following a vain effort at postponement by Grace's mother; she was never enamored with Coolidge, nor he with her. The newlyweds went on a honeymoon trip to Montreal, originally planned for two weeks but cut short by a week at Coolidge's request. After 25 years he wrote of Grace, \"for almost a quarter of a century she has borne with my infirmities and I have rejoiced in her graces\".\n\nThe Coolidges had two sons: John (September 7, 1906 – May 31, 2000) and Calvin Jr. (April 13, 1908 – July 7, 1924). Calvin's death at age 16 from blood poisoning brought on by an infected blister \"hurt him terribly,\" according to son John. John became a railroad executive, helped to start the Coolidge Foundation, and was instrumental in creating the President Calvin Coolidge State Historic Site. Coolidge was frugal, and when it came to securing a home, he insisted upon renting. Henry Field had a pew in Edwards Congregational Church, and Grace was a member, but Coolidge never formally joined the congregation.\n\nThe Republican Party was dominant in New England in Coolidge's time, and he followed Hammond's and Field's example by becoming active in local politics. In 1896, Coolidge campaigned for Republican presidential candidate William McKinley, and the next year he was selected to be a member of the Republican City Committee. In 1898, he won election to the City Council of Northampton, placing second in a ward where the top three candidates were elected. The position offered no salary, but provided Coolidge invaluable political experience. In 1899, he declined renomination, running instead for City Solicitor, a position elected by the City Council. He was elected for a one-year term in 1900, and reelected in 1901. This position gave Coolidge more experience as a lawyer and paid a salary of $600. In 1902, the city council selected a Democrat for city solicitor, and Coolidge returned to private practice. Soon thereafter, however, the clerk of courts for the county died, and Coolidge was chosen to replace him. The position paid well, but it barred him from practicing law, so he remained at the job for only one year. In 1904, Coolidge suffered his sole defeat at the ballot box, losing an election to the Northampton school board. When told that some of his neighbors voted against him because he had no children in the schools he would govern, Coolidge replied, \"Might give me time!\"\n\nIn 1906, the local Republican committee nominated Coolidge for election to the state House of Representatives. He won a close victory over the incumbent Democrat, and reported to Boston for the 1907 session of the Massachusetts General Court. In his freshman term, Coolidge served on minor committees and, although he usually voted with the party, was known as a Progressive Republican, voting in favor of such measures as women's suffrage and the direct election of Senators. While in Boston, Coolidge became an ally, and then a liegeman, of then U.S. Senator Winthrop Murray Crane who controlled the western faction of the Massachusetts Republican Party; Crane's party rival in the east of the commonwealth was U.S. Senator Henry Cabot Lodge. Another key strategic alliance which Coolidge forged was with Guy Currier, who had served in both state houses and had the social distinction, wealth, personal charm and broad circle of friends which Coolidge lacked, and which would have a lasting impact on his political career. In 1907, he was elected to a second term, and in the 1908 session, Coolidge was more outspoken, though not in a leadership position.\n\nInstead of vying for another term in the State House, Coolidge returned home to his growing family and ran for mayor of Northampton when the incumbent Democrat retired. He was well liked in the town, and defeated his challenger by a vote of 1,597 to 1,409. During his first term (1910 to 1911), he increased teachers' salaries and retired some of the city's debt while still managing to effect a slight tax decrease. He was renominated in 1911, and defeated the same opponent by a slightly larger margin.\n\nIn 1911, the State Senator for the Hampshire County area retired and successfully encouraged Coolidge to run for his seat for the 1912 session; Coolidge defeated his Democratic opponent by a large margin. At the start of that term, he became chairman of a committee to arbitrate the \"Bread and Roses\" strike by the workers of the American Woolen Company in Lawrence, Massachusetts. After two tense months, the company agreed to the workers' demands, in a settlement proposed by the committee. A major issue affecting Massachusetts Republicans that year was the party split between the progressive wing, which favored Theodore Roosevelt, and the conservative wing, which favored William Howard Taft. Although he favored some progressive measures, Coolidge refused to leave the Republican party. When the new Progressive Party declined to run a candidate in his state senate district, Coolidge won reelection against his Democratic opponent by an increased margin.\n\nIn the 1913 session, Coolidge enjoyed renowned success in arduously navigating to passage the Western Trolley Act which connected Northampton with a dozen similar industrial communities in western Massachusetts. Coolidge intended to retire after his second term as was the custom, but when the President of the State Senate, Levi H. Greenwood, considered running for Lieutenant Governor, Coolidge decided to run again for the Senate in the hopes of being elected as its presiding officer. Although Greenwood later decided to run for reelection to the Senate, he was defeated primarily due to his opposition to women's suffrage; Coolidge was in favor of the women's vote, won his own re-election and with Crane's help, assumed the presidency of a closely divided Senate. After his election in January 1914, Coolidge delivered a published and frequently quoted speech entitled \"Have Faith in Massachusetts\", which summarized his philosophy of government.\n\nCoolidge's speech was well received, and he attracted some admirers on its account; towards the end of the term, many of them were proposing his name for nomination to lieutenant governor. After winning reelection to the Senate by an increased margin in the 1914 elections, Coolidge was reelected unanimously to be President of the Senate. Coolidge's supporters, led by fellow Amherst alumnus Frank Stearns, encouraged him again to run for lieutenant governor. Stearns, an executive with the Boston department store R. H. Stearns, became another key ally, and began a publicity campaign on Coolidge's behalf before he announced his candidacy at the end of the 1915 legislative session.\n\nCoolidge entered the primary election for lieutenant governor and was nominated to run alongside gubernatorial candidate Samuel W. McCall. Coolidge was the leading vote-getter in the Republican primary, and balanced the Republican ticket by adding a western presence to McCall's eastern base of support. McCall and Coolidge won the 1915 election to their respective one-year terms, with Coolidge defeating his opponent by more than 50,000 votes.\n\nIn Massachusetts, the lieutenant governor does not preside over the state Senate, as is the case in many other states; nevertheless, as lieutenant governor, Coolidge was a deputy governor functioning as administrative inspector and was a member of the governor's council. He was also chairman of the finance committee and the pardons committee. As a full-time elected official, Coolidge discontinued his law practice in 1916, though his family continued to live in Northampton. McCall and Coolidge were both reelected in 1916 and again in 1917. When McCall decided that he would not stand for a fourth term, Coolidge announced his intention to run for governor.\n\nCoolidge was unopposed for the Republican nomination for Governor of Massachusetts in 1918. He and his running mate, Channing Cox, a Boston lawyer and Speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives, ran on the previous administration's record: fiscal conservatism, a vague opposition to Prohibition, support for women's suffrage, and support for American involvement in World War I. The issue of the war proved divisive, especially among Irish and German Americans. Coolidge was elected by a margin of 16,773 votes over his opponent, Richard H. Long, in the smallest margin of victory of any of his statewide campaigns.\n\nIn 1919, in reaction to a plan of the policemen of the Boston Police Department to register with a union, Police Commissioner Edwin U. Curtis announced that such an act would not be tolerated. In August of that year, the American Federation of Labor issued a charter to the Boston Police Union. Curtis declared the union's leaders were guilty of insubordination and would be relieved of duty, but indicated he would cancel their suspension if the union was dissolved by September 4. The mayor of Boston, Andrew Peters, convinced Curtis to delay his action for a few days, but with no results, and Curtis suspended the union leaders on September 8. The following day, about three-quarters of the policemen in Boston went on strike. Coolidge, tacitly but fully in support of Curtis' position, closely monitored the situation but initially deferred to the local authorities. He anticipated that only a resulting measure of lawlessness could sufficiently prompt the public to understand and appreciate the controlling principle – that a policeman does not strike. That night and the next, there was sporadic violence and rioting in the unruly city. Peters, concerned about sympathy strikes by the firemen and others, called up some units of the Massachusetts National Guard stationed in the Boston area pursuant to an old and obscure legal authority, and relieved Curtis of duty. \n\nCoolidge, sensing the severity of circumstances were then in need of his intervention, conferred with Crane's operative, William Butler, and then acted. He called up more units of the National Guard, restored Curtis to office, and took personal control of the police force. Curtis proclaimed that all of the strikers were fired from their jobs, and Coolidge called for a new police force to be recruited.\nThat night Coolidge received a telegram from AFL leader Samuel Gompers. \"Whatever disorder has occurred\", Gompers wrote, \"is due to Curtis's order in which the right of the policemen has been denied…\" Coolidge publicly answered Gompers's telegram, denying any justification whatsoever for the strike – and his response launched him into the national consciousness (quoted, above left). Newspapers across the nation picked up on Coolidge's statement and he became the newest hero to opponents of the strike. In the midst of the First Red Scare, many Americans were terrified of the spread of communist revolution, like those that had taken place in Russia, Hungary, and Germany. While Coolidge had lost some friends among organized labor, conservatives across the nation had seen a rising star. Although he usually acted with deliberation, the Boston police strike gave him a national reputation as a decisive leader, and as a strict enforcer of law and order.\n\nCoolidge and Cox were renominated for their respective offices in 1919. By this time Coolidge's supporters (especially Stearns) had publicized his actions in the Police Strike around the state and the nation and some of Coolidge's speeches were published in book form. He faced the same opponent as in 1918, Richard Long, but this time Coolidge defeated him by 125,101 votes, more than seven times his margin of victory from a year earlier. His actions in the police strike, combined with the massive electoral victory, led to suggestions that Coolidge run for president in 1920.\n\nBy the time Coolidge was inaugurated on January 2, 1919, the First World War had ended, and Coolidge pushed the legislature to give a $100 bonus to Massachusetts veterans. He also signed a bill reducing the work week for women and children from fifty-four hours to forty-eight, saying, \"We must humanize the industry, or the system will break down.\" He signed into law a budget that kept the tax rates the same, while trimming $4 million from expenditures, thus allowing the state to retire some of its debt.\n\nCoolidge also wielded the veto pen as governor. His most publicized veto prevented an increase in legislators' pay by 50%. Although Coolidge was personally opposed to Prohibition, he vetoed a bill in May 1920 that would have allowed the sale of beer or wine of 2.75% alcohol or less, in Massachusetts in violation of the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. \"Opinions and instructions do not outmatch the Constitution,\" he said in his veto message. \"Against it, they are void.\"\n\nAt the 1920 Republican National Convention, most of the delegates were selected by state party conventions, not primaries. As such, the field was divided among many local favorites. Coolidge was one such candidate, and while he placed as high as sixth in the voting, the powerful party bosses running the convention, primarily the party's U.S. Senators, never considered him seriously. After ten ballots, the bosses and then the delegates settled on Senator Warren G. Harding of Ohio as their nominee for president. When the time came to select a vice presidential nominee, the bosses also made and announced their decision on whom they wanted – Sen. Irvine Lenroot of Wisconsin – and then prematurely departed after his name was put forth, relying on the rank and file to confirm their decision. A delegate from Oregon, Wallace McCamant, having read \"Have Faith in Massachusetts\", proposed Coolidge for vice president instead. The suggestion caught on quickly with the masses starving for an act of independence from the absent bosses, and Coolidge was unexpectedly nominated.\n\nThe Democrats nominated another Ohioan, James M. Cox, for president and the Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Franklin D. Roosevelt, for vice president. The question of the United States joining the League of Nations was a major issue in the campaign, as was the unfinished legacy of Progressivism. Harding ran a \"front-porch\" campaign from his home in Marion, Ohio, but Coolidge took to the campaign trail in the Upper South, New York, and New England – his audiences carefully limited to those familiar with Coolidge and those placing a premium upon concise and short speeches. On November 2, 1920, Harding and Coolidge were victorious in a landslide, winning more than 60 percent of the popular vote, including every state outside the South. They also won in Tennessee, the first time a Republican ticket had won a Southern state since Reconstruction.\n\nThe U.S. vice presidency did not carry many official duties, but Coolidge was invited by President Harding to attend cabinet meetings, making him the first vice president to do so. He gave a number of unremarkable speeches around the country.\n\nAs the U.S. vice president, Coolidge and his vivacious wife Grace were invited to quite a few parties, where the legend of \"Silent Cal\" was born. It is from this time that most of the jokes and anecdotes involving Coolidge originate. Although Coolidge was known to be a skilled and effective public speaker, in private he was a man of few words and was commonly referred to as \"Silent Cal\". A possibly apocryphal story has it that a matron, seated next to him at a dinner, said to him, \"I made a bet today that I could get more than two words out of you.\" He replied, \"You lose.\" Dorothy Parker, upon learning that Coolidge had died, reportedly remarked, \"How can they tell?\" Coolidge often seemed uncomfortable among fashionable Washington society; when asked why he continued to attend so many of their dinner parties, he replied, \"Got to eat somewhere.\" Alice Roosevelt Longworth, a leading Republican wit, underscored Coolidge's silence and his dour personality: \"When he wished he were elsewhere, he pursed his lips, folded his arms, and said nothing. He looked then precisely as though he had been weaned on a pickle.\"\n\nAs president, Coolidge's reputation as a quiet man continued. \"The words of a President have an enormous weight,\" he would later write, \"and ought not to be used indiscriminately.\" Coolidge was aware of his stiff reputation; indeed, he cultivated it. \"I think the American people want a solemn ass as a President,\" he once told Ethel Barrymore, \"and I think I will go along with them.\" Some historians would later suggest that Coolidge's image was created deliberately as a campaign tactic, while others believe his withdrawn and quiet behavior to be natural, deepening after the death of his son in 1924.\n\nOn August 2, 1923, President Harding died unexpectedly in San Francisco while on a speaking tour of the western United States. Vice President Coolidge was in Vermont visiting his family home, which had neither electricity nor a telephone, when he received word by messenger of Harding's death. He dressed, said a prayer, and came downstairs to greet the reporters who had assembled. His father, a notary public and justice of the peace, administered the oath of office in the family's parlor by the light of a kerosene lamp at 2:47 a.m. on August 3, 1923; President Coolidge then went back to bed.\n\nCoolidge returned to Washington the next day, and was sworn in again by Justice Adolph A. Hoehling Jr. of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, to forestall any questions about the authority of a state official to administer a federal oath. This second oath taking remained a secret until it was revealed by Harry M. Daugherty in 1932, and confirmed by Hoehling. When Hoehling confirmed Daugherty's story, he indicated that Daugherty, then serving as United States Attorney General, asked him to administer the oath without fanfare at the Willard Hotel. According to Hoehling, he did not question Daugherty's reason for requesting a second oath taking, but assumed it was to resolve any doubt about whether the first swearing in was valid.\nThe nation initially did not know what to make of Coolidge, who had maintained a low profile in the Harding administration; many had even expected him to be replaced on the ballot in 1924. Coolidge believed that those of Harding's men under suspicion were entitled to every presumption of innocence, taking a methodical approach to the scandals, principally the Teapot Dome scandal, while others clamored for rapid punishment of those they presumed guilty. Coolidge thought the Senate investigations of the scandals would suffice; this was affirmed by the resulting resignations of those involved. He personally intervened in demanding the resignation of Attorney General Harry M. Daugherty after he refused to cooperate with the congressional probe. He then set about to confirm that no loose ends remained in the administration, arranging for a full briefing on the wrongdoing. Harry A. Slattery reviewed the facts with him, Harlan F. Stone analyzed the legal aspects for him and Senator William E. Borah assessed and presented the political factors.\n\nCoolidge addressed Congress when it reconvened on December 6, 1923, giving a speech that supported many of Harding's policies, including Harding's formal budgeting process, the enforcement of immigration restrictions and arbitration of coal strikes ongoing in Pennsylvania. Coolidge's speech was the first presidential speech to be broadcast over the radio. The Washington Naval Treaty was proclaimed just one month into Coolidge's term, and was generally well received in the country. In May 1924, the World War I veterans' World War Adjusted Compensation Act or \"Bonus Bill\" was passed over his veto. Coolidge signed the Immigration Act later that year, which was aimed at restricting southern and eastern European immigration, but appended a signing statement expressing his unhappiness with the bill's specific exclusion of Japanese immigrants. Just before the Republican Convention began, Coolidge signed into law the Revenue Act of 1924, which reduced the top marginal tax rate from 58% to 46%, as well as personal income tax rates across the board, increased the estate tax and bolstered it with a new gift tax.\n\nOn June 2, 1924, Coolidge signed the act granting citizenship to all Native Americans born in the United States. By that time, two-thirds of the people were already citizens, having gained it through marriage, military service (veterans of World War I were granted citizenship in 1919), or the land allotments that had earlier taken place.\n\nThe Republican Convention was held on June 10–12, 1924, in Cleveland, Ohio; Coolidge was nominated on the first ballot. The convention nominated Frank Lowden of Illinois for vice president on the second ballot, but he declined; former Brigadier General Charles G. Dawes was nominated on the third ballot and accepted.\n\nThe Democrats held their convention the next month in New York City. The convention soon deadlocked, and after 103 ballots, the delegates finally agreed on a compromise candidate, John W. Davis, with Charles W. Bryan nominated for vice president. The Democrats' hopes were buoyed when Robert M. La Follette Sr., a Republican senator from Wisconsin, split from the GOP to form a new Progressive Party. Many believed that the split in the Republican party, like the one in 1912, would allow a Democrat to win the presidency.\n\nAfter the conventions and the death of his younger son Calvin, Coolidge became withdrawn; he later said that \"when he [the son] died, the power and glory of the Presidency went with him.\" Even as he mourned, Coolidge ran his standard campaign, not mentioning his opponents by name or maligning them, and delivering speeches on his theory of government, including several that were broadcast over radio. It was the most subdued campaign since 1896, partly because of Coolidge's grief, but also because of his naturally non-confrontational style. The other candidates campaigned in a more modern fashion, but despite the split in the Republican party, the results were similar to those of 1920. Coolidge and Dawes won every state outside the South except Wisconsin, La Follette's home state. Coolidge won the election with 382 electoral voted and the popular vote by 2.5 million over his opponents' combined total.\n\nDuring Coolidge's presidency, the United States experienced a period of rapid economic growth known as the \"Roaring Twenties.\" He left the administration's industrial policy in the hands of his activist Secretary of Commerce, Herbert Hoover, who energetically used government auspices to promote business efficiency and develop airlines and radio. Coolidge disdained regulation, and demonstrated this by appointing commissioners to the Federal Trade Commission and the Interstate Commerce Commission who did little to restrict the activities of businesses under their jurisdiction. The regulatory state under Coolidge was, as one biographer described it, \"thin to the point of invisibility.\"\n\nCoolidge's economic policy has often been misquoted as \"generally speaking, the business of the American people is business\" (full quotation at right). Some have criticized Coolidge as an adherent of the laissez-faire ideology, which they claim led to the Great Depression. On the other hand, historian Robert Sobel offers some context based on Coolidge's sense of federalism: \"As Governor of Massachusetts, Coolidge supported wages and hours legislation, opposed child labor, imposed economic controls during World War I, favored safety measures in factories, and even worker representation on corporate boards. Did he support these measures while president? No, because in the 1920s, such matters were considered the responsibilities of state and local governments.\"\n\nCoolidge adopted the taxation policies of his Secretary of the Treasury, Andrew Mellon, the idea that \"scientific taxation\", lower taxes, increase rather than decrease government receipts. Congress agreed, and tax rates were reduced in Coolidge's term. In addition to federal tax cuts, Coolidge proposed reductions in federal expenditures and retiring of the federal debt. Coolidge's ideas were shared by the Republicans in Congress, and in 1924, Congress passed the Revenue Act of 1924, which reduced income tax rates and eliminated all income taxation for some two million people. They reduced taxes again by passing the Revenue Acts of 1926 and 1928, all the while continuing to keep spending down so as to reduce the overall federal debt. By 1927, only the wealthiest 2% of taxpayers paid any federal income tax. Federal spending remained flat during Coolidge's administration, allowing one-fourth of the federal debt to be retired in total. State and local governments saw considerable growth, however, surpassing the federal budget in 1927.\n\nPerhaps the most contentious issue of Coolidge's presidency was relief for farmers. Some in Congress proposed a bill designed to fight falling agricultural prices by allowing the federal government to purchase crops to sell abroad at lower prices. Agriculture Secretary Henry C. Wallace and other administration officials favored the bill when it was introduced in 1924, but rising prices convinced many in Congress that the bill was unnecessary, and it was defeated just before the elections that year. In 1926, with farm prices falling once more, Senator Charles L. McNary and Representative Gilbert N. Haugen—both Republicans—proposed the McNary–Haugen Farm Relief Bill. The bill proposed a federal farm board that would purchase surplus production in high-yield years and hold it (when feasible) for later sale or sell it abroad. Coolidge opposed McNary-Haugen, declaring that agriculture must stand \"on an independent business basis,\" and said that \"government control cannot be divorced from political control.\" Instead of manipulating prices, he favored instead Herbert Hoover's proposal to create profits by modernizing agriculture. Secretary Mellon wrote a letter denouncing the McNary-Haugen measure as unsound and likely to cause inflation, and it was defeated.\n\nAfter McNary-Haugen's defeat, Coolidge supported a less radical measure, the Curtis-Crisp Act, which would have created a federal board to lend money to farm co-operatives in times of surplus; the bill did not pass. In February 1927, Congress took up the McNary-Haugen bill again, this time narrowly passing it, and Coolidge vetoed it. In his veto message, he expressed the belief that the bill would do nothing to help farmers, benefiting only exporters and expanding the federal bureaucracy. Congress did not override the veto, but it passed the bill again in May 1928 by an increased majority; again, Coolidge vetoed it. \"Farmers never have made much money,\" said Coolidge, the Vermont farmer's son. \"I do not believe we can do much about it.\"\n\nCoolidge has often been criticized for his actions during the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, the worst natural disaster to hit the Gulf Coast until Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Although he did eventually name Secretary Hoover to a commission in charge of flood relief, scholars argue that Coolidge overall showed a lack of interest in federal flood control. Coolidge did not believe that personally visiting the region after the floods would accomplish anything, and that it would be seen as mere political grandstanding. He also did not want to incur the federal spending that flood control would require; he believed property owners should bear much of the cost. On the other hand, Congress wanted a bill that would place the federal government completely in charge of flood mitigation. When Congress passed a compromise measure in 1928, Coolidge declined to take credit for it and signed the bill in private on May 15.\n\nAccording to one biographer, Coolidge was \"devoid of racial prejudice,\" but rarely took the lead on civil rights. Coolidge disliked the Ku Klux Klan and no Klansman is known to have received an appointment from him. In the 1924 presidential election his opponents (Robert La Follette and John Davis), and his running mate Charles Dawes, often attacked the Klan but Coolidge avoided the subject, just as he avoided most controversial topics. \n\nCoolidge spoke in favor of the civil rights of African-Americans, saying in his first State of the Union address that their rights were \"just as sacred as those of any other citizen\" under the U.S. Constitution and that it was a \"public and a private duty to protect those rights.\"\n\nCoolidge repeatedly called for laws to make lynching a federal crime (it was already a state crime). Congress refused to pass any such legislation. On June 2, 1924, Coolidge signed the Indian Citizenship Act, which granted U.S. citizenship to all American Indians living on reservations (Indians off reservations had long been citizens). On June 6, 1924, Coolidge delivered a commencement address at historically black, non-segregated Howard University, in which he thanked and commended African-Americans for their rapid advances in education and their contributions to U.S. society over the years, as well as their eagerness to render their services as soldiers in the World War, all while being faced with discrimination and prejudices at home.\n\nIn a speech in October 1924, Coolidge stressed tolerance of differences as an American value and thanked immigrants for their contributions to U.S. society, saying that they have \"contributed much to making our country what it is.\" He stated that although the diversity of peoples was a detrimental source of conflict and tension in Europe, it was peculiar for the United States that it was a \"harmonious\" benefit for the country. Coolidge further stated the United States should assist and help immigrants who come to the country, and urged immigrants to reject \"race hatreds\" and \"prejudices\".\n\nAlthough not an isolationist, Coolidge was reluctant to enter into foreign alliances. He considered the 1920 Republican victory as a rejection of the Wilsonian position that the United States should join the League of Nations. While not completely opposed to the idea, Coolidge believed the League, as then constituted, did not serve American interests, and he did not advocate membership. He spoke in favor of the United States joining the Permanent Court of International Justice (World Court), provided that the nation would not be bound by advisory decisions. In 1926, the Senate eventually approved joining the Court (with reservations). The League of Nations accepted the reservations, but it suggested some modifications of its own. The Senate failed to act; the United States never joined the World Court.\n\nCoolidge's primary initiative was the Kellogg–Briand Pact of 1928, named for Coolidge's Secretary of State, Frank B. Kellogg, and French foreign minister Aristide Briand. The treaty, ratified in 1929, committed signatories—the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, and Japan—to \"renounce war, as an instrument of national policy in their relations with one another.\" The treaty did not achieve its intended result—the outlawry of war—but it did provide the founding principle for international law after World War II.\n\nCoolidge continued the previous administration's policy of withholding recognition of the Soviet Union. He also continued the United States' support for the elected government of Mexico against the rebels there, lifting the arms embargo on that country. He sent Dwight Morrow to Mexico as the American ambassador.\n\nThe United States' occupation of Nicaragua and Haiti continued under his administration, but Coolidge withdrew American troops from the Dominican Republic in 1924. Coolidge led the U.S. delegation to the Sixth International Conference of American States, January 15–17, 1928, in Havana, Cuba. This was the only international trip Coolidge made during his presidency. There, he extended an olive branch to Latin American leaders embittered over America's interventionist policies in Central America and the Caribbean. For 88 years he was the only sitting president to have visited Cuba, until Barack Obama did so in 2016.\n\nIn the summer of 1927, Coolidge vacationed in the Black Hills of South Dakota, where he engaged in horseback riding and fly fishing and attended rodeos. He made Custer State Park his \"summer White House.\" While on vacation, Coolidge surprisingly issued a terse statement that he would not seek a second full term as president: \"I do not choose to run for President in 1928.\" After allowing the reporters to take that in, Coolidge elaborated. \"If I take another term, I will be in the White House till 1933 … Ten years in Washington is longer than any other man has had it—too long!\" In his memoirs, Coolidge explained his decision not to run: \"The Presidential office takes a heavy toll of those who occupy it and those who are dear to them. While we should not refuse to spend and be spent in the service of our country, it is hazardous to attempt what we feel is beyond our strength to accomplish.\" After leaving office, he and Grace returned to Northampton, where he wrote his memoirs. The Republicans retained the White House in 1928 in the person of Coolidge's Secretary of Commerce, Herbert Hoover. Coolidge had been reluctant to endorse Hoover as his successor; on one occasion he remarked that \"for six years that man has given me unsolicited advice—all of it bad.\" Even so, Coolidge had no desire to split the party by publicly opposing the nomination of the popular commerce secretary.\n\nAlthough a few of Harding's cabinet appointees were scandal-tarred, Coolidge initially retained all of them, out of an ardent conviction that as successor to a deceased elected president he was obligated to retain Harding's counselors and policies until the next election. He kept Harding's able speechwriter Judson T. Welliver; Stuart Crawford replaced Welliver in November 1925. Coolidge appointed C. Bascom Slemp, a Virginia Congressman and experienced federal politician, to work jointly with Edward T. Clark, a Massachusetts Republican organizer whom he retained from his vice-presidential staff, as Secretaries to the President (a position equivalent to the modern White House Chief of Staff). \n\nPerhaps the most powerful person in Coolidge's Cabinet was Secretary of the Treasury Andrew Mellon, who controlled the administration's financial policies and was regarded by many, including House Minority Leader John Nance Garner, as more powerful than Coolidge himself. Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover also held a prominent place in Coolidge's Cabinet, in part because Coolidge found value in Hoover's ability to win positive publicity with his pro-business proposals. Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes directed Coolidge's foreign policy until he resigned in 1925 following Coolidge's re-election. He was replaced by Frank B. Kellogg, who had previously served as a Senator and as the ambassador to Great Britain. Coolidge made two other appointments following his re-election, with William M. Jardine taking the position of Secretary of Agriculture and John G. Sargent becoming Attorney General. Coolidge did not have a vice president during his first term, but Charles Dawes became vice president during Coolidge's second term, and Dawes and Coolidge clashed over farm policy and other issues.\n\nCoolidge appointed one justice to the Supreme Court of the United States, Harlan Fiske Stone in 1925. Stone was Coolidge's fellow Amherst alumnus, a Wall Street lawyer and conservative Republican. Stone was serving as dean of Columbia Law School when Coolidge appointed him to be attorney general in 1924 to restore the reputation tarnished by Harding's Attorney General, Harry M. Daugherty. Stone proved to be a firm believer in judicial restraint and was regarded as one of the court's three liberal justices who would often vote to uphold New Deal legislation. President Franklin D. Roosevelt later appointed Stone to be chief justice.\n\nCoolidge nominated 17 judges to the United States Courts of Appeals, and 61 judges to the United States district courts. He appointed judges to various specialty courts as well, including Genevieve R. Cline, who became the first woman named to the federal judiciary when Coolidge placed her on the United States Customs Court in 1928. Coolidge also signed the Judiciary Act of 1925 into law, allowing the Supreme Court more discretion over its workload.\n\nAfter his presidency, Coolidge retired to the modest rented house on residential Massasoit Street in Northampton before moving to a more spacious home, \"The Beeches.\" He kept a Hacker runabout boat on the Connecticut River and was often observed on the water by local boating enthusiasts. During this period, he also served as chairman of the non-partisan Railroad Commission, as honorary president of the American Foundation for the Blind, as a director of New York Life Insurance Company, as president of the American Antiquarian Society, and as a trustee of Amherst College.\n\nCoolidge published his autobiography in 1929 and wrote a syndicated newspaper column, \"Calvin Coolidge Says,\" from 1930 to 1931. Faced with looming defeat in the 1932 presidential election, some Republicans spoke of rejecting Herbert Hoover as their party's nominee, and instead drafting Coolidge to run, but the former president made it clear that he was not interested in running again, and that he would publicly repudiate any effort to draft him, should it come about. Hoover was renominated, and Coolidge made several radio addresses in support of him. Hoover then lost the general election to Coolidge's 1920 vice presidential Democratic opponent Franklin D. Roosevelt in a landslide\nCoolidge died suddenly from coronary thrombosis at \"The Beeches,\" at 12:45 p.m., January 5, 1933. Shortly before his death, Coolidge confided to an old friend: \"I feel I no longer fit in with these times.\" Coolidge is buried in Plymouth Notch Cemetery, Plymouth Notch, Vermont. The nearby family home is maintained as one of the original buildings on the Calvin Coolidge Homestead District site. The State of Vermont dedicated a new visitors' center nearby to mark Coolidge's 100th birthday on July 4, 1972.\n\nDespite his reputation as a quiet and even reclusive politician, Coolidge made use of the new medium of radio and made radio history several times while president. He made himself available to reporters, giving 520 press conferences, meeting with reporters more regularly than any president before or since. Coolidge's second inauguration was the first presidential inauguration broadcast on radio. On December 6, 1923, he was the first president whose address to Congress was broadcast on radio. Coolidge signed the Radio Act of 1927, which assigned regulation of radio to the newly created Federal Radio Commission. On August 11, 1924, Theodore W. Case, using the Phonofilm sound-on-film process he developed for Lee DeForest, filmed Coolidge on the White House lawn, making Coolidge the first president to appear in a sound film. The title of the DeForest film was \"President Coolidge, Taken on the White House Grounds\". When Charles Lindbergh arrived in Washington on a U.S. Navy ship after his celebrated 1927 trans-Atlantic flight, President Coolidge welcomed him back to the U.S. and a sound-on-film record of the event exists.\n\n\nScholarly sources\n\nArticles and book chapters\n\nPrimary sources\n\n"}
{"id": "6198", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6198", "title": "Convention on Biological Diversity", "text": "Convention on Biological Diversity\n\nThe Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), known informally as the Biodiversity Convention, is a multilateral treaty. The Convention has three main goals including: the conservation of biological diversity (or biodiversity); the sustainable use of its components; and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from genetic resources.\n\nIn other words, its objective is to develop national strategies for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity. It is often seen as the key document regarding sustainable development. The Convention was opened for signature at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro on 5 June 1992 and entered into force on 29 December 1993. At the 2010 10th Conference of Parties (COP) to the Convention on Biological Diversity in October in Nagoya, Japan, the Nagoya Protocol was adopted.\n\nThe notion of an international convention on biological diversity was conceived at a United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Ad Hoc Working Group of Experts on Biological Diversity in November 1988. The subsequent year, the Ad Hoc Working Group of Technical and Legal Experts was established for the drafting of a legal text which addressed the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity, as well as the sharing of benefits arising from their utilization with sovereign states and local communities.\nIn 1991, an intergovernmental negotiating committee was established, tasked with finalizing the convention's text.\n\nA Conference for the Adoption of the Agreed Text of the Convention on Biological Diversity was held in Nairobi, Kenya, in 1992, and its conclusions were distilled in the Nairobi Final Act. The Convention's text was opened for signature on 5 June 1992 at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (the Rio \"Earth Summit\"). By its closing date, 4 June 1993, the convention had received 168 signatures. It entered into force on 29 December 1993.\n\nThe convention recognized for the first time in international law that the conservation of biological conservation of biodiversity is \"a common concern of humankind\" and is an integral part of the development process. The agreement covers all ecosystems, species, and genetic resources. It links traditional conservation efforts to the economic goal of using biological resources sustainably. It sets principles for the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the use of genetic resources, notably those destined for commercial use. It also covers the rapidly expanding field of biotechnology through its Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, addressing technology development and transfer, benefit-sharing and biosafety issues. Importantly, the Convention is legally binding; countries that join it ('Parties') are obliged to implement its provisions.\n\nThe convention reminds decision-makers that natural resources are not infinite and sets out a philosophy of sustainable use. While past conservation efforts were aimed at protecting particular species and habitats, the Convention recognizes that ecosystems, species and genes must be used for the benefit of humans. However, this should be done in a way and at a rate that does not lead to the long-term decline of biological diversity.\n\nThe convention also offers decision-makers guidance based on the precautionary principle which demands that where there is a threat of significant reduction or loss of biological diversity, lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing measures to avoid or minimize such a threat. The Convention acknowledges that substantial investments are required to conserve biological diversity. It argues, however, that conservation will bring us significant environmental, economic and social benefits in return.\n\nThe Convention on Biological Diversity of 2010 banned some forms of geoengineering.\n\nSome of the many issues dealt with under the convention include:\n\n\nThe Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety of the Convention, also known as the Biosafety Protocol, was adopted in January 2000. The Biosafety Protocol seeks to protect biological diversity from the potential risks posed by living modified organisms resulting from modern biotechnology.\n\nThe Biosafety Protocol makes clear that products from new technologies must be based on the precautionary principle and allow developing nations to balance public health against economic benefits. It will for example let countries ban imports of a genetically modified organism if they feel there is not enough scientific evidence the product is safe and requires exporters to label shipments containing genetically modified commodities such as corn or cotton.\n\nThe required number of 50 instruments of ratification/accession/approval/acceptance by countries was reached in May 2003. In accordance with the provisions of its Article 37, the Protocol entered into force on 11 September 2003.\n\nIn April 2002, the parties of the UN CBD adopted the recommendations of the Gran Canaria Declaration Calling for a Global Plant Conservation Strategy, and adopted a 16-point plan aiming to slow the rate of plant extinctions around the world by 2010.\n\nAs of 2016, the Convention has 196 parties, which includes 195 states and the European Union. All UN member states—with the exception of the United States—have ratified the treaty. Non-UN member states that have ratified are the Cook Islands, Niue, and the State of Palestine. The Holy See and the states with limited recognition are non-parties. The US has signed but not ratified the treaty, and has not announced plans to ratify it.\n\nConference of the parties:\nThe convention's governing body is the Conference of the parties (COP), consisting of all governments (and regional economic integration organizations) that have ratified the treaty. This ultimate authority reviews progress under the Convention, identifies new priorities, and sets work plans for members. The COP can also make amendments to the Convention, create expert advisory bodies, review progress reports by member nations, and collaborate with other international organizations and agreements.\n\nThe Conference of the Parties uses expertise and support from several other bodies that are established by the Convention. In addition to committees or mechanisms established on an ad hoc basis, two main organs are:\n\nSecretariat:\nThe CBD Secretariat, based in Montreal, operates under the United Nations Environment Programme. Its main functions are to organize meetings, draft documents, assist member governments in the implementation of the programme of work, coordinate with other international organizations, and collect and disseminate information.\n\nSubsidiary body for Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice (SBSTTA):\nThe Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice (SBSTTA). The SBSTTA is a committee composed of experts from member governments competent in relevant fields. It plays a key role in making recommendations to the COP on scientific and technical issues. 13th Meeting of the Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice (SBSTTA-13) held from 18 to 22 February 2008 in the Food and Agriculture Organization at Rome, Italy. SBSTTA-13 delegates met in the Committee of the Whole in the morning to finalize and adopt recommendations on the in-depth reviews of the work programmes on agricultural and forest biodiversity and SBSTTA's modus operandi for the consideration of new and emerging issues. The closing plenary convened in the afternoon to adopt recommendations on inland waters biodiversity, marine biodiversity, invasive alien species and biodiversity and climate change. The current chairperson of the SBSTTA is Dr. Senka Barudanovic.\n\n\"National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs) are the principal instruments for implementing the Convention at the national level (Article 6). The Convention requires countries to prepare a national biodiversity strategy (or equivalent instrument) and to ensure that this strategy is mainstreamed into the planning and activities of all those sectors whose activities can have an impact (positive and negative) on biodiversity. To date [2012-02-01], 173 Parties have developed NBSAPs in line with Article 6.\"\n\nFor example, the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Tanzania have carried out elaborate responses to conserve individual species and specific habitats. The United States of America, a signatory who has not yet ratified the treaty, has produced one of the most thorough implementation programs through species Recovery Programs and other mechanisms long in place in the USA for species conservation.\n\nSingapore has also established a detailed \"National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan\". The \"National Biodiversity Centre\" of Singapore represents Singapore in the Convention for Biological Diversity.\n\nIn accordance with Article 26 of the Convention, Parties prepare national reports on the status of implementation of the Convention.\n\nThe current executive secretary is Cristiana Pașca Palmer, who took up this post on 17 March 2017. Braulio Ferreira de Souza Dias was the previous executive secretary.\n0000\n\nThe Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization to the Convention on Biological Diversity is a supplementary agreement to the Convention on Biological Diversity. It provides a transparent legal framework for the effective implementation of one of the three objectives of the CBD: the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources. The Protocol was adopted on 29 October 2010 in Nagoya, Aichi Province, Japan, and entered into force on 12 October 2014. Its objective is the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources, thereby contributing to the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity.\n\nThe first ordinary meeting of the parties to the convention took place in November and December 1994, in Nassau, Bahamas.\n\nThe second ordinary meeting of the parties to the convention took place in November 1995, in Jakarta, Indonesia.\n\nThe third ordinary meeting of the parties to the convention took place in November 1996, in Buenos Aires, Argentina.\n\nThe fourth ordinary meeting of the parties to the convention took place in May 1998, in Bratislava, Slovakia.\n\nThe First Extraordinary Meeting of the Conference of the Parties took place in February 1999, in Cartagena, Colombia.\n\nThe fifth ordinary meeting of the parties to the convention took place in May 2000, in Nairobi, Kenya.\n\nThe sixth ordinary meeting of the parties to the convention took place in April 2002, in The Hague, Netherlands.\n\nThe seventh ordinary meeting of the parties to the convention took place in February 2004, in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.\n\nThe eighth ordinary meeting of the parties to the convention took place in March 2006, in Curitiba, Brazil.\n\nThe ninth ordinary meeting of the parties to the convention took place in May 2008, in Bonn, Germany.\n\nThe tenth ordinary meeting of the parties to the convention took place in October 2010, in Nagoya, Japan.\n\nLeading up to the Conference of the Parties (COP 11) meeting on biodiversity in Hyderabad, India 2012, preparations for a World Wide Views on Biodiversity has begun, involving old and new partners and building on the experiences from the World Wide Views on Global Warming.\n\nUnder the theme, \"Biodiversity for Sustainable Development,\" thousands of representatives of governments, NGOs, indigenous peoples, scientists and the private sector gathered in Pyeongchang, Republic of Korea in October 2014 for the 12th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (COP 12).\n\nFrom 6–17 October 2014, Parties discussed the implementation of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 and its Aichi Biodiversity Targets, which are to be achieved by the end of this decade. The results of Global Biodiversity Outlook 4, the flagship assessment report of the CBD informed the discussions.\n\nThe conference gave a mid-term evaluation to the UN Decade on Biodiversity (2011-2020) initiative, which aims to promote the conservation and sustainable use of nature.\nAt the end of the meeting, the meeting adopted the \"Pyeongchang Road Map,\" which addresses ways to achieve biodiversity through technology cooperation, funding and strengthening the capacity of developing countries.\n\nThe thirteenth ordinary meeting of the parties to the convention took place between 2 and 17 December 2016 in Cancun, Mexico.\n\n2010 was the International Year of Biodiversity. The Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity is the focal point for the International Year of Biodiversity. On 22 December 2010, the UN declared the period from 2011 to 2020 as the United Nations Decade on Biodiversity. They, hence, followed a recommendation of the CBD signatories during COP10 at Nagoya in October 2010.\n\nAlthough the convention explicitly states that all forms of life are covered by its provisions, examination of reports and of national biodiversity strategies and action plans submitted by participating countries shows that in practice this is not happening. The fifth report of the European Union, for example, makes frequent reference to animals (particularly fish) and plants, but does not mention bacteria, fungi or protists at all. The International Society for Fungal Conservation has assessed more than 100 of these CBD documents for their coverage of fungi using defined criteria to place each in one of six categories. No documents were assessed as good or adequate, less than 10% as nearly adequate or poor, and the rest as deficient, seriously deficient or totally deficient.\n\n\n\"This article is partly based on the relevant entry in the CIA World Factbook, edition.\"\n\n\n"}

It is implemented by the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP), directed by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE).\n\nThe convention opened for signature on 1979-11-13 and entered into force on 1983-03-16.\n\nThe Convention, which now has 51 Parties, identifies the Executive Secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) as its secretariat. The current parties to the Convention are shown on the map.\n\nThe Convention is implemented by the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP) (short for \"Co-operative Programme for Monitoring and Evaluation of the Long-range Transmission of Air Pollutants in Europe\"). Results of the EMEP programme are published on the EMEP website, www.emep.int.\n\nSince 1979 the Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution has addressed some of the major environmental problems of the UNECE region through scientific collaboration and policy negotiation. The Convention has been extended by eight protocols that identify specific measures to be taken by Parties to cut their emissions of air pollutants:\n\n\nThe aim of the Convention is that Parties shall endeavour to limit and, as far as possible, gradually reduce and prevent air pollution including long-range transboundary air pollution. Parties develop policies and strategies to combat the discharge of air pollutants through exchanges of information, consultation, research and monitoring.\n\nThe Parties meet annually at sessions of the Executive Body to review ongoing work and plan future activities including a workplan for the coming year. The three main subsidiary bodies - the Working Group on Effects, the Steering Body to EMEP and the Working Group on Strategies and Review - as well as the Convention's Implementation Committee, report to the Executive Body each year.\n\nCurrently, the Convention's priority activities include review and possible revision of its most recent protocols, implementation of the Convention and its protocols across the entire UNECE region (with special focus on Eastern Europe, the Caucasus and Central Asia and South-East Europe) and sharing its knowledge and information with other regions of the world.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6201", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6201", "title": "CITES", "text": "CITES\n\nCITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, also known as the Washington Convention) is a multilateral treaty to protect endangered plants and animals. It was drafted as a result of a resolution adopted in 1963 at a meeting of members of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The convention was opened for signature in 1973 and CITES entered into force on 1 July 1975. Its aim is to ensure that international trade in specimens of wild animals and plants does not threaten the survival of the species in the wild, and it accords varying degrees of protection to more than 35,000 species of animals and plants. In order to ensure that the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) was not violated, the Secretariat of GATT was consulted during the drafting process.\n\n, Secretary-General of the CITES Secretariat is John E. Scanlon.\n\nCITES is one of the largest and oldest conservation and sustainable use agreements in existence. Participation is voluntary, and countries that have agreed to be bound by the Convention are known as Parties. Although CITES is legally binding on the Parties, it does not take the place of national laws. Rather it provides a framework respected by each Party, which must adopt their own domestic legislation to implement CITES at the national level. Often, domestic legislation is either non-existent (especially in Parties that have not ratified it), or with penalties with the gravity of the crime and insufficient deterrents to wildlife traders. As of 2002, 50% of Parties lacked one or more of the four major requirements for a Party: designation of Management and Scientific Authorities; laws prohibiting the trade in violation of CITES; penalties for such trade; laws providing for the confiscation of specimens.\n\nFunding for the activities of the Secretariat and Conference of the Parties (CoP) meetings comes from a Trust Fund derived from Party contributions. Trust Fund money is not available to Parties to improve implementation or compliance. These activities, and all those outside Secretariat activities (training, species specific programmes such as Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants - MIKE) must find external funding, mostly from donor countries and regional organizations such as the European Union.\n\nAlthough the Convention itself does not provide for arbitration or dispute in the case of noncompliance, 36 years of CITES in practice has resulted in several strategies to deal with infractions by Parties. The Secretariat, when informed of an infraction by a Party, will notify all other parties. The Secretariat will give the Party time to respond to the allegations and may provide technical assistance to prevent further infractions. Other actions the Convention itself does not provide for but that derive from subsequent COP resolutions may be taken against the offending Party. These include:\nBilateral sanctions have been imposed on the basis of national legislation (e.g. the USA used certification under the Pelly Amendment to get Japan to revoke its reservation to hawksbill turtle products in 1991, thus reducing the volume of its exports).\n\nInfractions may include negligence with respect to permit issuing, excessive trade, lax enforcement, and failing to produce annual reports (the most common).\n\nOriginally, CITES addressed depletion resulting from demand for luxury goods such as furs in Western countries, but with the rising wealth of Asia, particularly in China, the focus changed to products demanded there, particularly those used for luxury goods such as ivory or shark fins or for superstitious purposes such as rhinoceros horn. As of 2013 the demand was massive and had expanded to include thousands of species previously considered unremarkable and in no danger of extinction such as manta rays or pangolins.\n\nThe text of the Convention was finalized at a meeting of representatives of 80 countries in Washington, D.C., United States, on 3 March 1973. It was then open for signature until 31 December 1974. It entered into force after the 10th ratification by a signatory country, on 1 July 1975. Countries that signed the Convention become Parties by ratifying, accepting or approving it. By the end of 2003, all signatory countries had become Parties. States that were not signatories may become Parties by acceding to the Convention. As of October 2016, the Convention has 183 parties, including 182 states and the European Union.\n\nThe CITES Convention includes provisions and rules for trade with non-Parties. All member states of the United Nations are party to the treaty, with the exception of Andorra, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Federated States of Micronesia, Haiti, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, South Sudan, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Turkmenistan, and Tuvalu. UN observer the Holy See is also not a member. The Faroe Islands, an autonomous country in the Kingdom of Denmark, is also treated as a non-Party to CITES (both the Danish mainland and Greenland are part of CITES).\n\nAn amendment to the text of the Convention, known as the Gaborone Amendment allows regional economic integration organizations (REIO), such as the European Union, to have the status of a member state and to be a Party to the Convention. The REIO can vote at CITES meetings with the number of votes representing the number of members in the REIO, but it does not have an additional vote.\n\nIn accordance with Article XVII, paragraph 3, of the CITES Convention, the Gaborone Amendment entered into force on 29 November 2013, 60 days after 54 (two-thirds) of the 80 States that were party to CITES on 30 April 1983 deposited their instrument of acceptance of the amendment. At that time it entered into force only for those States that had accepted the amendment. The amended text of the Convention will apply automatically to any State that becomes a Party after 29 November 2013. For States that became party to the Convention before that date and have not accepted the amendment, it will enter into force 60 days after they accept it.\n\nCITES works by subjecting international trade in specimens of selected species to certain controls. All import, export, re-export and introduction from the sea of species covered by the Convention has to be authorized through a licensing system. According to Article IX of the Convention, Management and Scientific Authorities, each Party to the Convention must designate one or more Management Authorities in charge of administering that licensing system and one or more Scientific Authorities to advise them on the effects of trade on the status of CITES-listed species.\n\nRoughly 5,000 species of animals and 29,000 species of plants are protected by CITES against over-exploitation through international trade. Each protected species or population is included in one of three lists, called appendices (explained below). The Appendix that lists a species or population reflects the extent of the threat to it and the controls that apply to the trade.\n\nSpecies may be split-listed meaning that some populations of a species are on one Appendix, while some are on another. Some people argue that this is risky as specimens from a more protected population could be ‘laundered’ through the borders of a Party whose population is not as strictly protected. The African bush elephant (\"Loxodonta africana\") is currently split-listed, with all populations except those of Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe listed in Appendix I. Those of Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe are listed in Appendix II. Listing the species over the whole of its range would prevent such ‘laundering’ but also restricts trade in wildlife products by range states with good management practices. There are also species that have only some populations listed in an Appendix. One example is the pronghorn (\"Antilocapra americana\"), a ruminant native to North America. Its Mexican population is listed in Appendix I, but its U.S. and Canadian populations are not listed (though certain U.S. populations in Arizona are nonetheless protected under the Endangered Species Act).\n\nSpecies are proposed for inclusion in or deletion from the Appendices at meetings of the Conference of the Parties (CoP), which are held approximately once every three years, the most recent of which was CoP (CoP 17) in Johannesburg, South Africa from 24 September to 5 October 2016 at the Sandton Convention Center.\n\nSpecies in the Appendices may be proposed for addition, change of Appendix, or de-listing (i.e., deletion) by any Party, whether or not it is a range State and changes may be made despite objections by range States if there is sufficient (2/3 majority) support for the listing. These discussions are usually among the most contentious at CoP meetings.\n\nThere has been increasing willingness within the Parties to allow for trade in products from well-managed populations. For instance, sales of the South African white rhino have generated revenues that helped pay for protection. Listing the species on Appendix I increased the price of rhino horn (which fueled more poaching), but the species survived wherever there was adequate on-the-ground protection. Thus field protection may be the primary mechanism that saved the population, but it is likely that field protection would not have been increased without CITES protection.\n\nAppendix I, about 1200 species, are species that are threatened with extinction and are or may be affected by trade. Commercial trade in wild-caught specimens of these species is illegal (permitted only in exceptional licensed circumstances). Captive-bred animals or cultivated plants of Appendix I species are considered Appendix II specimens, with concomitant requirements (see below and Article VII). The Scientific Authority of the exporting country must make a non-detriment finding, assuring that export of the individuals will not adversely affect the wild population. Any trade in these species requires export and import permits. The Management Authority of the exporting state is expected to check that an import permit has been secured and that the importing state is able to care for the specimen adequately. Notable animal species listed in Appendix I include the red panda (\"Ailurus fulgens\"), western gorilla (\"Gorilla gorilla\"), the chimpanzee species (\"Pan spp.\"), tigers (\"Panthera tigris\" subspecies), Asiatic lion (\"Panthera leo persica\"), leopards (\"Panthera pardus\"), jaguar (\"Panthera onca\"), cheetah (\"Acinonyx jubatus\"), Asian elephant (\"Elephas maximus\"), some populations of African bush elephant (\"Loxodonta africana\"), the dugong and manatees (Sirenia), and all rhinoceros species (except some Southern African subspecies populations).\n\nAppendix II, about 21,000 species, are species that are not necessarily threatened with extinction, but may become so unless trade in specimens of such species is subject to strict regulation in order to avoid utilization incompatible with the survival of the species in the wild. In addition, Appendix II can include species similar in appearance to species already listed in the Appendices. International trade in specimens of Appendix II species may be authorized by the granting of an export permit or re-export certificate. In practice, many hundreds of thousands of Appendix II animals are traded annually. No import permit is necessary for these species under CITES, although some Parties do require import permits as part of their stricter domestic measures. A non-detriment finding and export permit are required by the exporting Party.\n\nIn addition, Article VII of CITES states that specimens of animals listed in Appendix I that are bred in captivity for commercial purposes are treated as Appendix II. The same applies for specimens of Appendix I plants artificially propagated for commercial purposes.\n\nExamples of species listed on Appendix II are the great white shark (\"Carcharodon carcharias\"), the American black bear (\"Ursus americanus\"), Hartmann's mountain zebra (\"Equus hartmannae\"), green iguana (\"Iguana iguana\"), queen conch (\"Strombus gigas\"), Emperor scorpion (\"Pandinus imperator\"), Mertens' water monitor (\"Varanus mertensi\"), bigleaf mahogany (\"Swietenia macrophylla\") and lignum vitae \"ironwood\" (\"Guaiacum officinale\").\n\nAppendix III, about 170 species, are species that are listed after one member country has asked other CITES Parties for assistance in controlling trade in a species. The species are not necessarily threatened with extinction globally. In all member countries, trade in these species is only permitted with an appropriate export permit and a certificate of origin from the state of the member country who has listed the species.\n\nExamples of species listed on Appendix III and the countries that listed them are the two-toed sloth (\"Choloepus hoffmanni\") by Costa Rica, African civet (\"Civettictis civetta\") by Botswana, and the alligator snapping turtle (\"Macrochelys temminckii\") by the USA.\n\nAmendments to the Convention must be supported by a two-thirds majority who are \"present and voting\" and can be made during an extraordinary meeting of the COP if one-third of the Parties are interested in such a meeting. The Gaborone Amendment (1983) allows regional economic blocs to accede to the treaty. Reservations (Article XXIII) can be made by any Party with respect to any species, which considerably weakens the treaty (see for current reservations). Trade with non-Party states is allowed, although permits and certificates are recommended to be issued by exporters and sought by importers.\n\nNotable reservations include those by Iceland, Japan and Norway on various baleen whale species and those on Falconiformes by Saudi Arabia.\n\nGeneral limitations about the structure and philosophy of CITES include: by design and intent it focuses on trade at the species level and does not address habitat loss, ecosystem approaches to conservation, or poverty; it seeks to prevent unsustainable use rather than promote sustainable use (which generally conflicts with the Convention on Biological Diversity), although this has been changing (see Nile crocodile, African elephant, South African white rhino case studies in Hutton and Dickinson 2000). It does not explicitly address market demand. Funding does not provide for increased on-the-ground enforcement (it must apply for bilateral aid for most projects of this nature).\n\nBy design, CITES regulates and monitors trade in the manner of a \"negative list\" such that trade in all species is permitted and unregulated \"unless\" the species in question appears on the Appendices or looks very much like one of those taxa. Then and only then, trade is regulated or constrained. Because the remit of the Convention covers millions of species of plants and animals, and tens of thousands of these taxa are potentially of economic value, in practice this negative list approach effectively forces CITES signatories to expend limited resources on just a select few, leaving many species to be traded with neither constraint nor review. For example, recently several bird classified as threatened with extinction appeared in the legal wild bird trade because the CITES process never considered their status. If a \"positive list\" approach were taken, only species evaluated and approved for the positive list would be permitted in trade, thus lightening the review burden for member states and the Secretariat, and also preventing inadvertent legal trade threats to poorly known species.\n\nSpecific weaknesses in the text include: it does not stipulate guidelines for the 'non-detriment' finding required of national Scientific Authorities; non-detriment findings require copious amounts of information; the 'household effects' clause is often not rigid enough/specific enough to prevent CITES violations by means of this Article (VII); non-reporting from Parties means Secretariat monitoring is incomplete; and it has no capacity to address domestic trade in listed species.\n\nSuggestions for improvement in the operation of CITES include: more regular missions by the Secretariat (not reserved just for high-profile species); improvement of national legislation and enforcement; better reporting by Parties (and the consolidation of information from all sources-NGOs, TRAFFIC, the wildlife trade monitoring network and Parties); more emphasis on enforcement-including a technical committee enforcement officer; the development of CITES Action Plans (akin to Biodiversity Action Plans related to the Convention on Biological Diversity) including: designation of Scientific/Management Authorities and national enforcement strategies; incentives for reporting and timelines for both Action Plans and reporting. CITES would benefit from access to Global Environment Facility (GEF), funds-although this is difficult given the GEFs more ecosystem approach-or other more regular funds. Development of a future mechanism similar to that of the Montreal Protocol (developed nations contribute to a fund for developing nations) could allow more funds for non-Secretariat activities.\n\nOn 15 July 2008, the Committee of Environmental Insecticides that oversees the administration of the convention between meetings of all the Parties granted China and Japan permission to import elephant ivory from four African government stockpiles, the ivory being sold at a single auction in each country. The amounts to be sold comprise approximately 44 tons from Botswana, 9 tons from Namibia, 51 tons from South Africa, and 4 tons from Zimbabwe. The Chinese government in 2003 acknowledged that it had lost track of 121 tons of ivory between 1991 and 2002.\n\nFrom 2005 – 2009 the legal trade corresponded with these numbers\nIn the 1990s the annual trade of legal animal products was $160 billion annually. In 2009 the estimated value almost doubled to $300 billion.\n\nThe Conference of the Parties (CoP) is held once every three years. The last Conference of the Parties (CoP 17) was held in Johannesburg, South Africa, and the one before it (CoP 16) was held in Bangkok, Thailand, in 2013. The next one (CoP 18) will be in Sri Lanka in 2019. The location of the next CoP is chosen at the close of each CoP by a secret ballot vote.\n\nThe CITES Committees (Animals Committee, Plants Committee and Standing Committee) hold meetings during each year that does not have a CoP, while the Standing committee meets also in years with a CoP. The Committee meetings take place in Geneva, Switzerland (where the Secretariat of the CITES Convention is located), unless another country offers to host the meeting. The Animals and Plants Committees have sometimes held joint meetings. The previous joint meeting was held in March 2012 in Dublin, Ireland, and the latest one was held in Veracruz, Mexico in May 2014.\n\nA current list of upcoming meetings appears on the CITES calendar at http://www.cites.org/eng/news/calendar.php.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It opened for signature on 18 May 1977 in Geneva and entered into force on 5 October 1978.\n\nThe Convention bans weather warfare, which is the use of weather modification techniques for the purposes of inducing damage or destruction. The Convention on Biological Diversity of 2010 would also ban some forms of weather modification or geoengineering.\n\nMany states do not regard this as a complete ban on the use of herbicides in warfare, such as Agent Orange, but it does require case-by-case consideration.\n\nThe Convention was signed by 48 states; 16 of the signatories have not ratified. As of June 2015, the Convention has 77 state parties.\n\nThe problem of artificial modification of the environment for military or other hostile purposes was brought to the international agenda in the early 1970s. Following the US decision of July 1972 to renounce the use of climate modification techniques for hostile purposes, the 1973 resolution by the US Senate calling for an international agreement \"prohibiting the use of any environmental or geophysical modification activity as a weapon of war\", and an in-depth review by the Department of Defense of the military aspects of weather and other environmental modification techniques, US decided to seek agreement with the Soviet Union to explore the possibilities of an international agreement.\n\nIn July 1974, US and USSR agreed to hold bilateral discussions on measures to overcome the danger of the use of environmental modification techniques for military purposes and three subsequent rounds of discussions in 1974 and 1975. In August 1975, US and USSR tabled identical draft texts of a convention at the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament (CCD), Conference on Disarmament, where intensive negotiations resulted in a modified text and understandings regarding four articles of this Convention in 1976.\n\nThe Convention was approved by Resolution 31/72 of the General Assembly of the United Nations on 10 December 1976, by 96 to 8 votes with 30 abstentions.\n\nEnvironmental Modification Technique includes any technique for changing – through the deliberate manipulation of natural processes – the dynamics, composition or structure of the earth, including its biota, lithosphere, hydrosphere and atmosphere, or of outer space.\n\nThe Convention contains ten articles and one Annex on the Consultative Committee of Experts. Integral part of the Convention are also the Understandings relating to articles I, II, III and VIII. These Understandings are not incorporated into the Convention but are part of the negotiating record and were included in the report transmitted by the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament to the United Nations General Assembly in September 1976 Report of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament, Volume I, General Assembly Official records: Thirty-first session, Supplement No. 27 (A/31/27), New York, United Nations, 1976, pp. 91–92.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6205", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6205", "title": "Chaitin's constant", "text": "Chaitin's constant\n\nIn the computer science subfield of algorithmic information theory, a Chaitin constant (Chaitin omega number) or halting probability is a real number that, informally speaking, represents the probability that a randomly constructed program will halt. These numbers are formed from a construction due to Gregory Chaitin.\n\nAlthough there are infinitely many halting probabilities, it is common to use the letter Ω to refer to them as if there were only one. Because Ω depends on the program encoding used, it is sometimes called Chaitin's construction instead of Chaitin's constant when not referring to any specific encoding.\n\nEach halting probability is a normal and transcendental real number that is not computable, which means that there is no algorithm to compute its digits. Indeed, each halting probability is Martin-Löf random, meaning there is not even any algorithm which can reliably guess its digits.\n\nThe definition of a halting probability relies on the existence of a prefix-free universal computable function. Such a function, intuitively, represents a programming language with the property that no valid program can be obtained as a proper extension of another valid program.\n\nSuppose that \"F\" is a partial function that takes one argument, a finite binary string, and possibly returns a single binary string as output. The function \"F\" is called computable if there is a Turing machine that computes it (in the sense that for any finite binary string \"x\" such that \"F(x) = y\" the Turing machine halts with \"y\" on its tape when given the input \"x\").\n\nThe function \"F\" is called universal if the following property holds: for every computable function \"f\" of a single variable there is a string \"w\" such that for all \"x\", \"F\"(\"w\" \"x\") = \"f\"(\"x\"); here \"w\" \"x\" represents the concatenation of the two strings \"w\" and \"x\". This means that \"F\" can be used to simulate any computable function of one variable. Informally, \"w\" represents a \"script\" for the computable function \"f\", and \"F\" represents an \"interpreter\" that parses the script as a prefix of its input and then executes it on the remainder of input.\n\nThe domain of \"F\" is the set of all inputs \"p\" on which it is defined. For \"F\" that are universal, such a \"p\" can generally be seen both as the concatenation of a program part and a data part, as a single program for the function \"F\".\n\nThe function \"F\" is called prefix-free if there are no two elements \"p\", \"p′\" in its domain such that \"p′\" is a proper extension of \"p\". This can be rephrased as: the domain of \"F\" is a prefix-free code (instantaneous code) on the set of finite binary strings. A simple way to enforce prefix-free-ness is to use machines whose means of input is a binary stream from which bits can be read one at a time. There is no end-of-stream marker; the end of input is determined by when the universal machine decides to stop reading more bits. Here, the difference between the two notions of program mentioned in the last paragraph becomes clear; one is easily recognized by some grammar, while the other requires arbitrary computation to recognize.\n\nThe domain of any universal computable function is a computably enumerable set but never a computable set. The domain is always Turing equivalent to the halting problem.\n\nLet \"P\" be the domain of a prefix-free universal computable function \"F\". The constant Ω is then defined as\nwhere formula_2 denotes the length of a string \"p\".\nThis is an infinite sum which has one summand for every \"p\" in the domain of \"F\". The requirement that the domain be prefix-free, together with Kraft's inequality, ensures that this sum converges to a real number between 0 and 1. If \"F\" is clear from context then Ω may be denoted simply Ω, although different prefix-free universal computable functions lead to different values of Ω.\n\nKnowing the first \"N\" bits of Ω, one could calculate the halting problem for all programs of a size up to \"N\". Let the program \"p\" for which the halting problem is to be solved be \"N\" bits long. In dovetailing fashion, all programs of all lengths are run, until enough have halted to jointly contribute enough probability to match these first \"N\" bits. If the program \"p\" hasn't halted yet, then it never will, since its contribution to the halting probability would affect the first \"N\" bits. Thus, the halting problem would be solved for \"p\".\n\nBecause many outstanding problems in number theory, such as Goldbach's conjecture are equivalent to solving the halting problem for special programs (which would basically search for counter-examples and halt if one is found), knowing enough bits of Chaitin's constant would also imply knowing the answer to these problems. But as the halting problem is not generally solvable, and therefore calculating any but the first few bits of Chaitin's constant is not possible, this just reduces hard problems to impossible ones, much like trying to build an oracle machine for the halting problem would be.\n\nThe Cantor space is the collection of all infinite sequences of 0s and 1s. A halting probability can be interpreted as the measure of a certain subset of Cantor space under the usual probability measure on Cantor space. It is from this interpretation that halting probabilities take their name.\n\nThe probability measure on Cantor space, sometimes called the fair-coin measure, is defined so that for any binary string \"x\" the set of sequences that begin with \"x\" has measure 2. This implies that for each natural number \"n\", the set of sequences \"f\" in Cantor space such that \"f\"(\"n\") = 1 has measure 1/2, and the set of sequences whose \"n\"th element is 0 also has measure 1/2.\n\nLet \"F\" be a prefix-free universal computable function. The domain \"P\" of \"F\" consists of an infinite set of binary strings\nEach of these strings \"p\" determines a subset \"S\" of Cantor space; the set \"S\" contains all sequences in cantor space that begin with \"p\". These sets are disjoint because \"P\" is a prefix-free set. The sum\nrepresents the measure of the set \n\nIn this way, Ω represents the probability that a randomly selected infinite sequence of 0s and 1s begins with a bit string (of some finite length) that is in the domain of \"F\". It is for this reason that Ω is called a halting probability.\n\nEach Chaitin constant Ω has the following properties:\n\nNot every set that is Turing equivalent to the halting problem is a halting probability. A finer equivalence relation, Solovay equivalence, can be used to characterize the halting probabilities among the left-c.e. reals.\n\nA real number is called computable if there is an algorithm which, given \"n\", returns the first \"n\" digits of the number. This is equivalent to the existence of a program that enumerates the digits of the real number.\n\nNo halting probability is computable. The proof of this fact relies on an algorithm which, given the first \"n\" digits of Ω, solves Turing's halting problem for programs of length up to \"n\". Since the halting problem is undecidable, Ω cannot be computed.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows. Given the first \"n\" digits of Ω and a \"k\"≤\"n\", the algorithm enumerates the domain of \"F\" until enough elements of the domain have been found so that the probability they represent is within 2 of Ω. After this point, no additional program of length \"k\" can be in the domain, because each of these would add 2 to the measure, which is impossible. Thus the set of strings of length \"k\" in the domain is exactly the set of such strings already enumerated.\n\nA real number is random if the binary sequence representing the real number is an algorithmically random sequence. \nCalude, Hertling, Khoussainov, and Wang showed\nthat a recursively enumerable real number is an algorithmically random sequence if and only if it is a Chaitin's Ω number.\n\nFor each specific consistent effectively represented axiomatic system for the natural numbers, such as Peano arithmetic, there exists a constant \"N\" such that no bit of Ω after the \"N\"th can be proven to be 1 or 0 within that system. The constant \"N\" depends on how the formal system is effectively represented, and thus does not directly reflect the complexity of the axiomatic system. This incompleteness result is similar to Gödel's incompleteness theorem in that it shows that no consistent formal theory for arithmetic can be complete.\n\nAs mentioned above, the first n bits of Gregory Chaitin's constant Ω are random or incompressible in the sense that we cannot compute them by a halting algorithm with fewer than n-O(1) bits. However, consider the short but never halting algorithm which systematically lists and runs all possible programs; whenever one of them halts its probability gets added to the output (initialized by zero). After finite time the first n bits of the output will never change any more (it does not matter that this time itself is not computable by a halting program). So there is a short non-halting algorithm whose output converges (after finite time) onto the first n bits of Ω. In other words, the enumerable first n bits of Ω are highly compressible in the sense that they are limit-computable by a very short algorithm; they are not random with respect to the set of enumerating algorithms. Jürgen Schmidhuber (2000) constructed a limit-computable \"Super Ω\" which in a sense is much more random than the original limit-computable Ω, as one cannot significantly compress the Super Ω by any enumerating non-halting algorithm.\n\nFor an alternative \"Super Ω\", the universality probability of a prefix-free Universal Turing Machine (UTM) - namely, the probability that it remains universal even when every input of it (as a binary string) is prefixed by a random binary string - can be seen as the non-halting probability of a machine with oracle the third iteration of the halting problem\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6206", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6206", "title": "Computable number", "text": "Computable number\n\nIn mathematics, computable numbers are the real numbers that can be computed to within any desired precision by a finite, terminating algorithm. They are also known as the recursive numbers or the computable reals or recursive reals.\n\nEquivalent definitions can be given using μ-recursive functions, Turing machines, or λ-calculus as the formal representation of algorithms. The computable numbers form a real closed field and can be used in the place of real numbers for many, but not all, mathematical purposes.\n\nIn the following, Marvin Minsky defines the numbers to be computed in a manner similar to those defined by Alan Turing in 1936; i.e., as \"sequences of digits interpreted as decimal fractions\" between 0 and 1:\n\nThe key notions in the definition are (1) that some \"n\" is specified at the start, (2) for any \"n\" the computation only takes a finite number of steps, after which the machine produces the desired output and terminates.\n\nAn alternate form of (2) – the machine successively prints all n of the digits on its tape, halting after printing the n – emphasizes Minsky's observation: (3) That by use of a Turing machine, a \"finite\" definition – in the form of the machine's table – is being used to define what is a potentially-\"infinite\" string of decimal digits.\n\nThis is however not the modern definition which only requires the result be accurate to within any given accuracy. The informal definition above is subject to a rounding problem called the table-maker's dilemma whereas the modern definition is not.\n\nA real number \"a\" is computable if it can be approximated by some computable function formula_1 in the following manner: given any positive integer \"n\", the function produces an integer \"f\"(\"n\") such that:\n\nThere are two similar definitions that are equivalent:\n\nThere is another equivalent definition of computable numbers via computable Dedekind cuts. A computable Dedekind cut is a computable function formula_8 which when provided with a rational number formula_9 as input returns formula_10 or formula_11, satisfying the following conditions:\nAn example is given by a program \"D\" that defines the cube root of 3. Assuming formula_15 this is defined by:\n\nA real number is computable if and only if there is a computable Dedekind cut \"D\" converging to it. The function \"D\" is unique for each computable number (although of course two different programs may provide the same function).\n\nA complex number is called computable if its real and imaginary parts are computable.\n\nWhile the set of real numbers is uncountable, the set of computable numbers is only countable and thus almost all real numbers are not computable. That the computable numbers are at most countable intuitively comes from the fact that they are produced by Turing machines, of which there are only countably many. More precisely, assigning a Gödel number to each Turing machine definition produces a subset formula_18 of the natural numbers corresponding to the computable numbers and identifies a surjection from formula_18 to the computable numbers, which shows that the computable numbers are subcountable. Moreover, for any computable number formula_20 the well ordering principle provides that there is a minimal element in formula_18 which corresponds to formula_22, and therefore there exists a subset formula_23 consisting of the minimal elements, on which the map is a bijection. The inverse of this bijection is an injection into the natural numbers of the computable numbers, proving that they are countable.\n\nThe set formula_18 of these Gödel numbers, however, is not computably enumerable (nor consequently is formula_25), even though the computable reals are themselves ordered. This is because there is no algorithm to determine which Gödel numbers correspond to Turing machines that produce computable reals. In order to produce a computable real, a Turing machine must compute a total function, but the corresponding decision problem is in Turing degree 0′′. Consequently, there is no surjective computable function from the natural numbers to the computable reals, and Cantor's diagonal argument cannot be used constructively to demonstrate uncountably many of them.\n\nThe arithmetical operations on computable numbers are themselves computable in the sense that whenever real numbers \"a\" and \"b\" are computable then the following real numbers are also computable: \"a + b\", \"a - b\", \"ab\", and \"a/b\" if \"b\" is nonzero.\nThese operations are actually \"uniformly computable\"; for example, there is a Turing machine which on input (\"A\",\"B\",formula_26) produces output \"r\", where \"A\" is the description of a Turing machine approximating \"a\", \"B\" is the description of a Turing machine approximating \"b\", and \"r\" is an formula_26 approximation of \"a\"+\"b\".\n\nThe fact that computable real numbers form a field was first proved by Henry Gordon Rice (1954).\n\nComputable reals do not form however a computable field, because the definition of the latter notion requires effective equality.\n\nThe order relation on the computable numbers is not computable. Let \"A\" be the description of a Turing machine approximating the number formula_6. Then there is no Turing machine which on input \"A\" outputs \"YES\" if formula_29 and \"NO\" if formula_30. The reason: suppose the machine described by \"A\" keeps outputting 0 as formula_26 approximations. It is not clear how long to wait before deciding that the machine will \"never\" output an approximation which forces \"a\" to be positive. Thus the machine will eventually have to guess that the number will equal 0, in order to produce an output; the sequence may later become different from 0. This idea can be used to show that the machine is incorrect on some sequences if it computes a total function. A similar problem occurs when the computable reals are represented as Dedekind cuts. The same holds for the equality relation : the equality test is not computable.\n\nWhile the full order relation is not computable, the restriction of it to pairs of unequal numbers is computable. That is, there is a program that takes as input two Turing machines \"A\" and \"B\" approximating numbers \"a\" and \"b\", where \"a\" ≠ \"b\", and outputs whether formula_32 or formula_33. It is sufficient to use ε-approximations where formula_34 so by taking increasingly small ε (with a limit to 0), one eventually can decide whether formula_32 or formula_33.\n\nThe computable real numbers do not share all the properties of the real numbers used in analysis. For example, the least upper bound of a bounded increasing computable sequence of computable real numbers need not be a computable real number (Bridges and Richman, 1987:58). A sequence with this property is known as a Specker sequence, as the first construction is due to E. Specker (1949). Despite the existence of counterexamples such as these, parts of calculus and real analysis can be developed in the field of computable numbers, leading to the study of computable analysis.\n\nEvery computable number is definable, but not vice versa. There are many definable, noncomputable real numbers, including:\nBoth of these examples in fact define an infinite set of definable, uncomputable numbers, one for each Universal Turing machine.\nA real number is computable if and only if the set of natural numbers it represents (when written in binary and viewed as a characteristic function) is computable.\n\nEvery computable number is arithmetical.\n\nThe set of computable real numbers (as well as every countable, densely ordered subset of computable reals without ends) is order-isomorphic to the set of rational numbers.\n\nTuring's original paper defined computable numbers as follows:\n\nTuring was aware that this definition is equivalent to the formula_26-approximation definition given above. The argument proceeds as follows: if a number is computable in the Turing sense, then it is also computable in the formula_26 sense: if formula_42, then the first \"n\" digits of the decimal expansion for \"a\" provide an formula_26 approximation of \"a\". For the converse, we pick an formula_26 computable real number \"a\" and generate increasingly precise approximations until the \"n\"th digit after the decimal point is certain. This always generates a decimal expansion equal to \"a\" but it may improperly end in an infinite sequence of 9's in which case it must have a finite (and thus computable) proper decimal expansion.\n\nUnless certain topological properties of the real numbers are relevant it is often more convenient to deal with elements of formula_45 (total 0,1 valued functions) instead of reals numbers in formula_46. The members of formula_45 can be identified with binary decimal expansions but since the decimal expansions formula_48 and formula_49 denote the same real number the interval formula_46 can only be bijectively (and homeomorphically under the subset topology) identified with the subset of formula_45 not ending in all 1's.\n\nNote that this property of decimal expansions means it's impossible to effectively identify computable real numbers defined in terms of a decimal expansion and those defined in the formula_26 approximation sense. Hirst has shown there is no algorithm which takes as input the description of a Turing machine which produces formula_26 approximations for the computable number \"a\", and produces as output a Turing machine which enumerates the digits of \"a\" in the sense of Turing's definition (see Hirst 2007). Similarly it means that the arithmetic operations on the computable reals are not effective on their decimal representations as when adding decimal numbers, in order to produce one digit it may be necessary to look arbitrarily far to the right to determine if there is a carry to the current location. This lack of uniformity is one reason that the contemporary definition of computable numbers uses formula_26 approximations rather than decimal expansions.\n\nHowever, from a computational or measure theoretic perspective the two structures formula_45 and formula_46 are essentially identical. and computability theorists often refer to members of formula_45 as reals. While formula_46 formula_45 is totally disconnected for questions about formula_60 classes or randomness it's much less messy to work in formula_45.\n\nElements of formula_62 are sometimes called reals as well and though containing a homeomorphic image of formula_63 formula_62 in addition to being totally disconnected isn't even locally compact. This leads to genuine differences in the computational properties. For instance the formula_65 satisfying formula_66 with formula_67 quantifier free must be computable while the unique formula_68 satisfying a universal formula can be arbitrarily high in the hyperarithmetic hierarchy.\n\nThe computable numbers include many of the specific real numbers which appear in practice, including all real algebraic numbers, as well as \"e\", formula_69, and many other transcendental numbers. Though the computable reals exhaust those reals we can calculate or approximate, the assumption that all reals are computable leads to substantially different conclusions about the real numbers. The question naturally arises of whether it is possible to dispose of the full set of reals and use computable numbers for all of mathematics. This idea is appealing from a constructivist point of view, and has been pursued by what Bishop and Richman call the \"Russian school\" of constructive mathematics.\n\nTo actually develop analysis over computable numbers, some care must be taken. For example, if one uses the classical definition of a sequence, the set of computable numbers is not closed under the basic operation of taking the supremum of a bounded sequence (for example, consider a Specker sequence). This difficulty is addressed by considering only sequences which have a computable modulus of convergence. The resulting mathematical theory is called computable analysis.\n\nThere are some computer packages that work with computable real numbers,\nrepresenting the real numbers as programs computing approximations.\nOne example is the RealLib package (reallib home page).\n\n\n\nComputable numbers were defined independently by Turing, Post and Church. See \"The Undecidable\", ed. Martin Davis, for further original papers.\n"}
{"id": "6207", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6207", "title": "Electric current", "text": "Electric current\n\nAn electric current is a flow of electric charge. In electric circuits this charge is often carried by moving electrons in a wire. It can also be carried by ions in an electrolyte, or by both ions and electrons such as in an ionised gas (plasma).\n\nThe SI unit for measuring an electric current is the ampere, which is the flow of electric charge across a surface at the rate of one coulomb per second. Electric current is measured using a device called an ammeter.\n\nElectric currents cause Joule heating, which creates light in incandescent light bulbs. They also create magnetic fields, which are used in motors, inductors and generators.\n\nThe moving charged particles in an electric current are called charge carriers. In metals, one or more electrons from each atom are loosely bound to the atom, and can move freely about within the metal. These conduction electrons are the charge carriers in metal conductors.\n\nThe conventional symbol for current is , which originates from the French phrase \"intensité de courant\", (current intensity). Current intensity is often referred to simply as \"current\". The symbol was used by André-Marie Ampère, after whom the unit of electric current is named, in formulating Ampère's force law (1820). The notation travelled from France to Great Britain, where it became standard, although at least one journal did not change from using to until 1896.\n\nIn a conductive material, the moving charged particles which constitute the electric current are called charge carriers. In metals, which make up the wires and other conductors in most electrical circuits, the positively charged atomic nuclei are held in a fixed position, and the negatively charged electrons are free to move, carrying their charge from one place to another. In other materials, notably the semiconductors, the charge carriers can be positive \"or\" negative, depending on the dopant used. Positive and negative charge carriers may even be present at the same time, as happens in an electrolyte in an electrochemical cell.\n\nA flow of positive charges gives the same electric current, and has the same effect in a circuit, as an equal flow of negative charges in the opposite direction. Since current can be the flow of either positive or negative charges, or both, a convention is needed for the direction of current that is independent of the type of charge carriers. The direction of \"conventional current\" is arbitrarily defined as the same direction as positive charges flow.\n\nThe consequence of this convention is that electrons, the charge carriers in metal wires and most other parts of electric circuits, flow in the opposite direction of conventional current flow in an electrical circuit.\n\nSince the current in a wire or component can flow in either direction, when a variable is defined to represent that current, the direction representing positive current must be specified, usually by an arrow on the circuit schematic diagram. This is called the \"reference direction\" of current . If the current flows in the opposite direction, the variable has a negative value.\n\nWhen analyzing electrical circuits, the actual direction of current through a specific circuit element is usually unknown. Consequently, the reference directions of currents are often assigned arbitrarily. When the circuit is solved, a negative value for the variable means that the actual direction of current through that circuit element is opposite that of the chosen reference direction.\nIn electronic circuits, the reference current directions are often chosen so that all currents are toward ground. This often corresponds to the actual current direction, because in many circuits the power supply voltage is positive with respect to ground.\n\nOhm's law states that the current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the potential difference across the two points. Introducing the constant of proportionality, the resistance, one arrives at the usual mathematical equation that describes this relationship:\n\nwhere \"I\" is the current through the conductor in units of amperes, \"V\" is the potential difference measured \"across\" the conductor in units of volts, and \"R\" is the resistance of the conductor in units of ohms. More specifically, Ohm's law states that the \"R\" in this relation is constant, independent of the current.\n\nIn alternating current (AC) systems, the movement of electric charge periodically reverses direction. AC is the form of electric power most commonly delivered to businesses and residences. The usual waveform of an AC power circuit is a sine wave. Certain applications use different waveforms, such as triangular or square waves. Audio and radio signals carried on electrical wires are also examples of alternating current. An important goal in these applications is recovery of information encoded (or \"modulated\") onto the AC signal.\n\nIn contrast, direct current (DC) is the unidirectional flow of electric charge, or a system in which the movement of electric charge is in one direction only. Direct current is produced by sources such as batteries, thermocouples, solar cells, and commutator-type electric machines of the dynamo type. Direct current may flow in a conductor such as a wire, but can also flow through semiconductors, insulators, or even through a vacuum as in electron or ion beams. An old name for direct current was \"galvanic current\".\n\nNatural observable examples of electrical current include lightning, static electric discharge, and the solar wind, the source of the polar auroras.\n\nMan-made occurrences of electric current include the flow of conduction electrons in metal wires such as the overhead power lines that deliver electrical energy across long distances and the smaller wires within electrical and electronic equipment. Eddy currents are electric currents that occur in conductors exposed to changing magnetic fields. Similarly, electric currents occur, particularly in the surface, of conductors exposed to electromagnetic waves. When oscillating electric currents flow at the correct voltages within radio antennas, radio waves are generated.\n\nIn electronics, other forms of electric current include the flow of electrons through resistors or through the vacuum in a vacuum tube, the flow of ions inside a battery or a neuron, and the flow of holes within a semiconductor.\n\nCurrent can be measured using an ammeter.\n\nAt the circuit level, there are various techniques that can be used to measure current:\n\nJoule heating, also known as \"ohmic heating\" and \"resistive heating\", is the process by which the passage of an electric current through a conductor releases heat. It was first studied by James Prescott Joule in 1841. Joule immersed a length of wire in a fixed mass of water and measured the temperature rise due to a known current through the wire for a 30 minute period. By varying the current and the length of the wire he deduced that the heat produced was proportional to the square of the current multiplied by the electrical resistance of the wire.\n\nThis relationship is known as Joule's First Law. The SI unit of energy was subsequently named the joule and given the symbol \"J\". The commonly known unit of power, the watt, is equivalent to one joule per second.\n\nIn an electromagnet a coil, of a large number of circular turns of insulated wire, wrapped on a cylindrical core, behaves like a magnet when an electric current flows through it. When the current is switched off, the coil loses its magnetism immediately. We call such a device as an electromagnet.\nElectric current produces a magnetic field. The magnetic field can be visualized as a pattern of circular field lines surrounding the wire that persists as long as there is current.\n\nMagnetism can also produce electric currents. When a changing magnetic field is applied to a conductor, an Electromotive force (EMF) is produced, and when there is a suitable path, this causes current.\n\nElectric current can be directly measured with a galvanometer, but this method involves breaking the electrical circuit, which is sometimes inconvenient. Current can also be measured without breaking the circuit by detecting the magnetic field associated with the current. Devices used for this include Hall effect sensors, current clamps, current transformers, and Rogowski coils.\n\nWhen an electric current flows in a suitably shaped conductor at radio frequencies radio waves can be generated. These travel at the speed of light and can cause electric currents in distant conductors.\n\nIn metallic solids, electric charge flows by means of electrons, from lower to higher electrical potential. In other media, any stream of charged objects (ions, for example) may constitute an electric current. To provide a definition of current independent of the type of charge carriers, \"conventional current\" is defined as moving in the same direction as the positive charge flow. So, in metals where the charge carriers (electrons) are negative, conventional current is in the opposite direction as the electrons. In conductors where the charge carriers are positive, conventional current is in the same direction as the charge carriers.\n\nIn a vacuum, a beam of ions or electrons may be formed. In other conductive materials, the electric current is due to the flow of both positively and negatively charged particles at the same time. In still others, the current is entirely due to positive charge flow. For example, the electric currents in electrolytes are flows of positively and negatively charged ions. In a common lead-acid electrochemical cell, electric currents are composed of positive hydrogen ions (protons) flowing in one direction, and negative sulfate ions flowing in the other. Electric currents in sparks or plasma are flows of electrons as well as positive and negative ions. In ice and in certain solid electrolytes, the electric current is entirely composed of flowing ions.\n\nIn a metal, some of the outer electrons in each atom are not bound to the individual atom as they are in insulating materials, but are free to move within the metal lattice. These conduction electrons can serve as charge carriers, carrying a current. Metals are particularly conductive because there are a large number of these free electrons, typically one per atom in the lattice. With no external electric field applied, these electrons move about randomly due to thermal energy but, on average, there is zero net current within the metal. At room temperature, the average speed of these random motions is 10 metres per second. Given a surface through which a metal wire passes, electrons move in both directions across the surface at an equal rate. As George Gamow wrote in his popular science book, \"One, Two, Three...Infinity\" (1947), \"The metallic substances differ from all other materials by the fact that the outer shells of their atoms are bound rather loosely, and often let one of their electrons go free. Thus the interior of a metal is filled up with a large number of unattached electrons that travel aimlessly around like a crowd of displaced persons. When a metal wire is subjected to electric force applied on its opposite ends, these free electrons rush in the direction of the force, thus forming what we call an electric current.\"\n\nWhen a metal wire is connected across the two terminals of a DC voltage source such as a battery, the source places an electric field across the conductor. The moment contact is made, the free electrons of the conductor are forced to drift toward the positive terminal under the influence of this field. The free electrons are therefore the charge carrier in a typical solid conductor.\n\nFor a steady flow of charge through a surface, the current \"I\" (in amperes) can be calculated with the following equation:\nwhere \"Q\" is the electric charge transferred through the surface over a time \"t\". If \"Q\" and \"t\" are measured in coulombs and seconds respectively, \"I\" is in amperes.\n\nMore generally, electric current can be represented as the rate at which charge flows through a given surface as:\n\nElectric currents in electrolytes are flows of electrically charged particles (ions). For example, if an electric field is placed across a solution of Na and Cl (and conditions are right) the sodium ions move towards the negative electrode (cathode), while the chloride ions move towards the positive electrode (anode). Reactions take place at both electrode surfaces, absorbing each ion.\n\nWater-ice and certain solid electrolytes called proton conductors contain positive hydrogen ions (\"protons\") that are mobile. In these materials, electric currents are composed of moving protons, as opposed to the moving electrons in metals.\n\nIn certain electrolyte mixtures, brightly coloured ions are the moving electric charges. The slow progress of the colour makes the current visible.\n\nIn air and other ordinary gases below the breakdown field, the dominant source of electrical conduction is via relatively few mobile ions produced by radioactive gases, ultraviolet light, or cosmic rays. Since the electrical conductivity is low, gases are dielectrics or insulators. However, once the applied electric field approaches the breakdown value, free electrons become sufficiently accelerated by the electric field to create additional free electrons by colliding, and ionizing, neutral gas atoms or molecules in a process called avalanche breakdown. The breakdown process forms a plasma that contains enough mobile electrons and positive ions to make it an electrical conductor. In the process, it forms a light emitting conductive path, such as a spark, arc or lightning.\n\nPlasma is the state of matter where some of the electrons in a gas are stripped or \"ionized\" from their molecules or atoms. A plasma can be formed by high temperature, or by application of a high electric or alternating magnetic field as noted above. Due to their lower mass, the electrons in a plasma accelerate more quickly in response to an electric field than the heavier positive ions, and hence carry the bulk of the current. The free ions recombine to create new chemical compounds (for example, breaking atmospheric oxygen into single oxygen [O → 2O], which then recombine creating ozone [O]).\n\nSince a \"perfect vacuum\" contains no charged particles, it normally behaves as a perfect insulator. However, metal electrode surfaces can cause a region of the vacuum to become conductive by injecting free electrons or ions through either field electron emission or thermionic emission. Thermionic emission occurs when the thermal energy exceeds the metal's work function, while field electron emission occurs when the electric field at the surface of the metal is high enough to cause tunneling, which results in the ejection of free electrons from the metal into the vacuum. Externally heated electrodes are often used to generate an electron cloud as in the filament or indirectly heated cathode of vacuum tubes. Cold electrodes can also spontaneously produce electron clouds via thermionic emission when small incandescent regions (called cathode spots or anode spots) are formed. These are incandescent regions of the electrode surface that are created by a localized high current. These regions may be initiated by field electron emission, but are then sustained by localized thermionic emission once a vacuum arc forms. These small electron-emitting regions can form quite rapidly, even explosively, on a metal surface subjected to a high electrical field. Vacuum tubes and sprytrons are some of the electronic switching and amplifying devices based on vacuum conductivity.\n\nSuperconductivity is a phenomenon of exactly zero electrical resistance and expulsion of magnetic fields occurring in certain materials when cooled below a characteristic critical temperature. It was discovered by Heike Kamerlingh Onnes on April 8, 1911 in Leiden. Like ferromagnetism and atomic spectral lines, superconductivity is a quantum mechanical phenomenon. It is characterized by the Meissner effect, the complete ejection of magnetic field lines from the interior of the superconductor as it transitions into the superconducting state. The occurrence of the Meissner effect indicates that superconductivity cannot be understood simply as the idealization of \"perfect conductivity\" in classical physics.\n\nIn a semiconductor it is sometimes useful to think of the current as due to the flow of positive \"holes\" (the mobile positive charge carriers that are places where the semiconductor crystal is missing a valence electron). This is the case in a p-type semiconductor. A semiconductor has electrical conductivity intermediate in magnitude between that of a conductor and an insulator. This means a conductivity roughly in the range of 10 to 10 siemens per centimeter (S⋅cm).\n\nIn the classic crystalline semiconductors, electrons can have energies only within certain bands (i.e. ranges of levels of energy). Energetically, these bands are located between the energy of the ground state, the state in which electrons are tightly bound to the atomic nuclei of the material, and the free electron energy, the latter describing the energy required for an electron to escape entirely from the material. The energy bands each correspond to a large number of discrete quantum states of the electrons, and most of the states with low energy (closer to the nucleus) are occupied, up to a particular band called the \"valence band\". Semiconductors and insulators are distinguished from metals because the valence band in any given metal is nearly filled with electrons under usual operating conditions, while very few (semiconductor) or virtually none (insulator) of them are available in the \"conduction band\", the band immediately above the valence band.\n\nThe ease of exciting electrons in the semiconductor from the valence band to the conduction band depends on the band gap between the bands. The size of this energy band gap serves as an arbitrary dividing line (roughly 4 eV) between semiconductors and insulators.\n\nWith covalent bonds, an electron moves by hopping to a neighboring bond. The Pauli exclusion principle requires that the electron be lifted into the higher anti-bonding state of that bond. For delocalized states, for example in one dimension – that is in a nanowire, for every energy there is a state with electrons flowing in one direction and another state with the electrons flowing in the other. For a net current to flow, more states for one direction than for the other direction must be occupied. For this to occur, energy is required, as in the semiconductor the next higher states lie above the band gap. Often this is stated as: full bands do not contribute to the electrical conductivity. However, as a semiconductor's temperature rises above absolute zero, there is more energy in the semiconductor to spend on lattice vibration and on exciting electrons into the conduction band. The current-carrying electrons in the conduction band are known as \"free electrons\", though they are often simply called \"electrons\" if that is clear in context.\n\nCurrent density is a measure of the density of an electric current. It is defined as a vector whose magnitude is the electric current per cross-sectional area. In SI units, the current density is measured in amperes per square metre.\n\nwhere \"formula_6\" is current in the conductor, formula_7 is the current density, and formula_8 is the differential cross-sectional area vector.\n\nThe current density (current per unit area) \"formula_7\" in materials with finite resistance is directly proportional to the electric field formula_10 in the medium. The proportionality constant is called the conductivity \"formula_11\" of the material, whose value depends on the material concerned and, in general, is dependent on the temperature of the material:\n\nThe reciprocal of the conductivity \"formula_11\" of the material is called the resistivity \"formula_14\" of the material and the above equation, when written in terms of resistivity becomes:\n\nConduction in semiconductor devices may occur by a combination of drift and diffusion, which is proportional to diffusion constant formula_17 and charge density formula_18. The current density is then:\n\nwith formula_20 being the elementary charge and formula_21 the electron density. The carriers move in the direction of decreasing concentration, so for electrons a positive current results for a positive density gradient. If the carriers are holes, replace electron density formula_21 by the negative of the hole density formula_23.\n\nIn linear anisotropic materials, \"σ\", \"ρ\" and \"D\" are tensors.\n\nIn linear materials such as metals, and under low frequencies, the current density across the conductor surface is uniform. In such conditions, Ohm's law states that the current is directly proportional to the potential difference between two ends (across) of that metal (ideal) resistor (or other ohmic device):\n\nwhere formula_6 is the current, measured in amperes; formula_26 is the potential difference, measured in volts; and formula_27 is the resistance, measured in ohms. For alternating currents, especially at higher frequencies, skin effect causes the current to spread unevenly across the conductor cross-section, with higher density near the surface, thus increasing the apparent resistance.\n\nThe mobile charged particles within a conductor move constantly in random directions, like the particles of a gas. (More accurately, a Fermi gas.) To create a net flow of charge, the particles must also move together with an average drift rate. Electrons are the charge carriers in metals and they follow an erratic path, bouncing from atom to atom, but generally drifting in the opposite direction of the electric field. The speed they drift at can be calculated from the equation:\nwhere\nTypically, electric charges in solids flow slowly. For example, in a copper wire of cross-section 0.5 mm, carrying a current of 5 A, the drift velocity of the electrons is on the order of a millimetre per second. To take a different example, in the near-vacuum inside a cathode ray tube, the electrons travel in near-straight lines at about a tenth of the speed of light.\n\nAny accelerating electric charge, and therefore any changing electric current, gives rise to an electromagnetic wave that propagates at very high speed outside the surface of the conductor. This speed is usually a significant fraction of the speed of light, as can be deduced from Maxwell's Equations, and is therefore many times faster than the drift velocity of the electrons. For example, in AC power lines, the waves of electromagnetic energy propagate through the space between the wires, moving from a source to a distant load, even though the electrons in the wires only move back and forth over a tiny distance.\n\nThe ratio of the speed of the electromagnetic wave to the speed of light in free space is called the velocity factor, and depends on the electromagnetic properties of the conductor and the insulating materials surrounding it, and on their shape and size.\n\nThe magnitudes (not the natures) of these three velocities can be illustrated by an analogy with the three similar velocities associated with gases. (See also hydraulic analogy.)\n"}

At the request of the Huguenots at Metz, he pleaded its cause at the court of King Louis XIV, urging that it should be excepted in the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, but his efforts were unsuccessful, and he joined his father in Berlin. He was at once appointed by Elector Frederick III \"\"juge et directeur de colonie de Berlin\".\" Before this, he had published several works on the revocation of the Edict of Nantes and its consequences, but his literary capacity was mediocre, his style stiff and cold, and it was his personal character rather than his reputation as a writer that earned him the confidence of the elector.\n\nIn 1687 Ancillon was appointed head of the so-called \"Academie des nobles,\" the principal educational establishment of the state; later on, as councillor of embassy, he took part in the negotiations which led to the assumption of the title of \"King in Prussia\" by the elector.

{"id": "6210", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6210", "title": "Clark Ashton Smith", "text": "Clark Ashton Smith\n\nClark Ashton Smith (January 13, 1893 – August 14, 1961) was a self-educated American poet, sculptor, painter and author of fantasy, horror and science fiction short stories. He achieved early local recognition, largely through the enthusiasm of George Sterling, for traditional verse in the vein of Swinburne. As a poet, Smith is grouped with the West Coast Romantics alongside Ambrose Bierce, Joaquin Miller, Sterling, Nora May French, and remembered as \"The Last of the Great Romantics\" and \"The Bard of Auburn\".\n\nSmith was one of \"the big three of \"Weird Tales\", with Robert E. Howard and H. P. Lovecraft\", but some readers objected to his morbidness and violation of pulp traditions. The fantasy critic L. Sprague de Camp said of him that \"nobody since Poe has so loved a well-rotted corpse.\" Smith was a member of the Lovecraft circle and his literary friendship with Lovecraft lasted from 1922 until Lovecraft's death in 1937. His work is marked by an extraordinarily rich and ornate vocabulary, a cosmic perspective and a vein of sardonic and sometimes ribald humor.\n\nOf his writing style, Smith stated that: \"My own conscious ideal has been to delude the reader into accepting an impossibility, or series of impossibilities, by means of a sort of verbal black magic, in the achievement of which I make use of prose-rhythm, metaphor, simile, tone-color, counter-point, and other stylistic resources, like a sort of incantation.\"\n\nSmith was born January 13, 1893, in Long Valley, California, of English and New England parentage. He spent most of his life in the small town of Auburn, California, living in a small cabin built by his parents, Fanny and Timeus Smith. His formal education was limited: he suffered from psychological disorders including a fear of crowds, and although admitted to high school after attending eight years of grammar school (Long Valley School, whence dates the earliest known photo of him), he never went to high school. His parents decided it was better for him to be educated at home.\n\nHowever, he was an insatiable reader, and continued to teach himself after he left school. His education began with the reading of \"Robinson Crusoe\" (unabridged), \"Gulliver's Travels\", the fairy tales of Hans Christian Andersen and Madame d'Aulnoy, the \"Arabian Nights\" and (at the age of 13) the poems of Edgar Allan Poe. He read an unabridged dictionary (the 13th edition of Webster's) through, word for word, studying not only the definitions of the words but also their derivations from ancient languages. Having an extraordinary eidetic memory, he seems to have retained most or all of it.\n\nThe other main course in Smith's self-education was to read the 11th edition of the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" through at least twice. Smith later taught himself French and Spanish in order to translate verse out of those languages. Smith professed to hate the provinciality of the small town of Auburn but rarely left it until he married late in life.\n\nHis first literary efforts, at the age of 11, took the form of fairy tales and imitations of the Arabian Nights. Later, he wrote long adventure novels dealing with Oriental life. By 14 he had already written a short adventure novel called \"The Black Diamonds\" which was lost for years until published in 2002. Another juvenile novel was written in his teenaged years—\"The Sword of Zagan\" (unpublished until 2004). Like \"The Black Diamonds\", it uses a medieval, \"Arabian Nights\"-like setting, and the \"Arabian Nights\", like the fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm and the works of Edgar Allan Poe, are known to have strongly influenced Smith's early writing, as did William Beckford's \"Vathek\".\n\nAt age 17, he sold several tales to \"The Black Cat\", a magazine which specialized in unusual tales. He also published some tales in the \"Overland Monthly\" in this brief foray into fiction which preceded his poetic career.\n\nHowever, it was primarily poetry that motivated the young Smith and he confined his efforts to poetry for more than a decade. In his later youth, Smith made the acquaintance of the San Francisco poet George Sterling through a member of the local Auburn Monday Night Club, where he read several of his poems with considerable success. On a month-long visit to Sterling in Carmel, California, Smith was introduced by Sterling to the poetry of Baudelaire.\n\nHe became Sterling's protégé and Sterling helped him to publish his first volume of poems, \"The Star-Treader and Other Poems\", at the age of 19. Smith received international acclaim for the collection. \"The Star-Treader\" was received very favorably by American critics, one of whom named Smith \"the Keats of the Pacific\". Smith briefly moved among the circle that included Ambrose Bierce and Jack London, but his early fame soon faded away.\n\nA little later, Smith's health broke down and for eight years his literary production was intermittent, though he produced his best poetry during this period. A small volume, \"Odes and Sonnets\", was brought out in 1918. Smith came into contact with literary figures who would later form part of H.P. Lovecraft's circle of correspondents; Smith knew them far earlier than Lovecraft. These figures include poet Samuel Loveman and bookman George Kirk. It was Smith who in fact later introduced Donald Wandrei to Lovecraft. For this reason, it has been suggested that Lovecraft might as well be referred to as a member of a \"Smith\" circle as Smith was a member of a Lovecraft one.\n\nIn 1920 Smith composed a celebrated long poem in blank verse, \"The Hashish Eater, or The Apocalypse of Evil\" which was published in \"Ebony and Crystal\" (1922). This was followed by a fan letter from H. P. Lovecraft, which was the beginning of 15 years of friendship and correspondence. With studied playfulness, Smith and Lovecraft borrowed each other's coinages of place names and the names of strange gods for their stories, though so different is Smith's treatment of the Lovecraft theme that it has been dubbed the \"Clark Ashton Smythos.\"\n\nIn 1925 Smith published \"Sandalwood\", which was partly funded by a gift of $50 from Donald Wandrei. He wrote little fiction in this period with the exception of some imaginative vignettes or prose poems. Smith was poor for most of his life and often did hard manual jobs such as fruit picking and woodcutting in order to support himself and his parents. He was an able cook and made many kinds of wine. He also did well digging, typing and journalism, as well as contributing a column to \"The Auburn Journal\" and sometimes worked as its night editor.\n\nOne of Smith's artistic patrons and frequent correspondents was San Francisco businessman Albert M. Bender.\n\nAt the beginning of the Depression in 1929, with his aged parents' health weakening, Smith resumed fiction writing and turned out more than a hundred short stories between 1929 and 1934, nearly all of which can be classed as weird horror or science fiction. Like Lovecraft, he drew upon the nightmares that had plagued him during youthful spells of sickness. Brian Stableford has written that the stories written during this brief phase of hectic productivity \"constitute one of the most remarkable oeuvres in imaginative literature\".\n\nHe published at his own expense a volume containing six of his best stories, \"The Double Shadow and Other Fantasies\", in an edition of 1000 copies printed by the \"Auburn Journal\". The theme of much of his work is egotism and its supernatural punishment; his weird fiction is generally macabre in subject matter, gloatingly preoccupied with images of death, decay and abnormality.\n\nMost of Smith's weird fiction falls into four series set variously in Hyperborea, Poseidonis, Averoigne and Zothique. Hyperborea, which is a lost continent of the Miocene period, and Poseidonis, which is a remnant of Atlantis, are much the same, with a magical culture characterized by bizarreness, cruelty, death and postmortem horrors. Averoigne is Smith's version of pre-modern France, comparable to James Branch Cabell's Poictesme. Zothique exists millions of years in the future. It is \"the last continent of earth, when the sun is dim and tarnished\". These tales have been compared to the \"Dying Earth\" sequence of Jack Vance.\n\nIn 1933 Smith began corresponding with Robert E. Howard, the Texan creator of Conan the Barbarian. From 1933 to 1936, Smith, Howard and Lovecraft were the leaders of the Weird Tales school of fiction and corresponded frequently, although they never met. The writer of oriental fantasies E. Hoffmann Price is the only man known to have met all three in the flesh.\n\nCritic Steve Behrends has suggested that the frequent theme of 'loss' in Smith's fiction (many of his characters attempt to recapture a long-vanished youth, early love, or picturesque past) may reflect Smith's own feeling that his career had suffered a \"fall from grace\":\n\nIn September 1935, Smith's mother Fanny died. Smith spent the next two years nursing his father through his last illness. Timeus died in December 1937. Aged 44, Smith now virtually ceased writing fiction. He had been severely affected by several tragedies occurring in a short period of time: Robert E. Howard's death by suicide (1936), Lovecraft's death from cancer (1937) and the deaths of his parents, which left him exhausted. As a result, he withdrew from the scene, marking the end of \"Weird Tales\"' Golden Age. He began sculpting and resumed the writing of poetry. However, Smith was visited by many writers at his cabin, including Fritz Leiber, Rah Hoffman, Francis T. Laney and others.\n\nIn 1942, three years after August Derleth founded Arkham House for the purpose of preserving the work of H.P. Lovecraft, Derleth published the first of several major collections of Smith's fiction, \"Out of Space and Time\" (1942). This was followed by \"Lost Worlds\" (1944). The books sold slowly, went out of print and became costly rarities. Derleth published five more volumes of Smith's prose and two of his verse, and at his death in 1971 had a large volume of Smith's poems in press.\n\nIn 1953 Smith suffered a coronary attack. Aged 61, he married Carol(yn) Jones Dorman on November 10, 1954. Dorman had much experience in Hollywood and radio public relations. After honeymooning at the Smith cabin, they moved to Pacific Grove, California, where he set up a household with their children. (Carol had been married before and had three children). For several years he alternated between the house on Indian Ridge and his wife's house in Pacific Grove. Having sold most of his father's tract, in 1957 the old house burned—the Smiths believed by arson, others said by accident.\n\nSmith now reluctantly did gardening for other residents at Pacific Grove, and grew a goatee. He spent much time shopping and walking near the seafront but despite Derleth's badgering, resisted the writing of more fiction. In 1961 he suffered strokes. In August 1961 he quietly died in his sleep, aged 68. After Smith's death Carol remarried (becoming Carolyn Wakefield) and subsequently died of cancer.\n\nThe poet's ashes were buried beside, or beneath, a boulder to the immediate west of where his childhood home (destroyed by fire in 1957) stood; some were also scattered in a stand of blue oaks near the boulder. There was no marker. In more recent times a plaque to his memory has been erected at the Auburn, California, Placer County Library.\n\nBookseller Roy A. Squires was appointed Smith's \"west coast executor\", with Jack L. Chalker as his \"east coast executor\". Squires published many letterpress editions of individual Smith poems.\n\nSmith's literary estate is represented by his stepson, Prof William Dorman, director of CASiana Literary Enterprises. Arkham House owns the copyright to many Smith stories, though some are now in the public domain.\n\nFor 'posthumous collaborations' of Smith (stories completed by Lin Carter), see the entry on Lin Carter.\n\nWhile Smith was always an artist who worked in several very different media, it is possible to identify three distinct periods in which one form of art had precedence over the others.\n\nSmith published most of his volumes of poetry in this period, including the aforementioned \"The Star-Treader and Other Poems\", as well as \"Odes and Sonnets\" (1918), \"Ebony and Crystal\" (1922) and \"Sandalwood\" (1925). His long poem \"The Hashish-Eater; Or, the Apocalypse of Evil\" was written in 1920.\n\nSmith wrote most of his weird fiction and Cthulhu Mythos stories, partially inspired by H. P. Lovecraft. Creatures of his invention include Aforgomon, Rlim-Shaikorth, Mordiggian, Tsathoggua, the wizard Eibon, and various others. In an homage to his friend, Lovecraft referred in \"The Whisperer in Darkness\" and \"The Battle That Ended the Century\" (written in collaboration with R. H. Barlow) to an Atlantean high-priest, \"Klarkash-Ton.\"\n\nSmith's weird stories form several cycles, called after the lands in which they are set: Averoigne, Hyperborea, Mars, Poseidonis, Zothique. To some extent Smith was influenced in his vision of such lost worlds by the teachings of Theosophy and the writings of Helena Blavatsky. Stories set in Zothique belong to the Dying Earth subgenre. Amongst Smith's science fiction tales are stories set on Mars and the invented planet of Xiccarph.\n\nHis short stories originally appeared in the magazines \"Weird Tales\", \"Strange Tales\", \"Astounding Stories\", \"Stirring Science Stories\" and \"Wonder Stories\".\n\nClark Ashton Smith was the third member of the great triumvirate of \"Weird Tales\", with Lovecraft and Robert E. Howard.\n\nMany of Smith's stories were published in six hardcover volumes by August Derleth under his Arkham House imprint. For a full bibliography to 1978, see Sidney-Fryer, \"Emperor of Dreams\" (cited below). S.T. Joshi is working with other scholars to produce an updated bibliography of Smith's work.\n\nA selection of Smith's best-known tales includes:\n\nBy this time his interest in writing fiction began to lessen and he turned to creating sculptures from soft rock such as soapstone. Smith also made hundreds of fantastic paintings and drawings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScholars S.T. Joshi and David E. Schultz are preparing various volumes of Smith's letters to such of his individual correspondents as Donald Wandrei, Robert H. Barlow, and August Derleth.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6211", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6211", "title": "Context-sensitive grammar", "text": "Context-sensitive grammar\n\nA context-sensitive grammar (CSG) is a formal grammar in which the left-hand sides and right-hand sides of any production rules may be surrounded by a context of terminal and nonterminal symbols. Context-sensitive grammars are more general than context-free grammars, in the sense that there are languages that can be described by CSG but not by context-free grammars. Context-sensitive grammars are less general (in the same sense) than unrestricted grammars. Thus, CSG are positioned between context-free and unrestricted grammars in the Chomsky hierarchy.\n\nA formal language that can be described by a context-sensitive grammar, or, equivalently, by a noncontracting grammar or a linear bounded automaton, is called a context-sensitive language. Some textbooks actually define CSGs as non-contracting, although this is not how Noam Chomsky defined them in 1959. This choice of definition makes no difference in terms of the languages generated (i.e. the two definitions are weakly equivalent), but it does make a difference in terms of what grammars are structurally considered context-sensitive; the later issue was analyzed by Chomsky in 1963.\n\nChomsky introduced context-sensitive grammars as a way to describe the syntax of natural language where it is often the case that a word may or may not be appropriate in a certain place depending on the context. Walter Savitch has criticized the terminology \"context-sensitive\" as misleading and proposed \"non-erasing\" as better explaining the distinction between a CSG and an unrestricted grammar.\n\nAlthough it is well-known that certain features of languages (e.g. cross-serial dependency) are not context-free, it is an open question how much of CSG's expressive power is needed to capture the context sensitivity found in natural languages. Subsequent research in this area has focused on the more computationally tractable mildly context-sensitive languages.\n\nA formal grammar \"G\" = (\"N\", Σ, \"P\", \"S\"), where \"N\" is a set of nonterminal symbols, Σ is a set of terminal symbols, \"P\" is a set of production rules, and \"S\" is the start symbol, is context-sensitive if all rules in \"P\" are of the form\nwhere \"A\" ∈ \"N\", α,β ∈ (\"N\"∪Σ) and γ ∈ (\"N\"∪Σ).\n\nA string \"u\" ∈ (\"N\"∪Σ) directly yields, or directly derives to, a string \"v\" ∈ (\"N\"∪Σ), denoted as \"u\" ⇒ \"v\", if \"u\" can be written as \"l\"α\"A\"β\"r\", and \"v\" can be written as \"l\"αγβ\"r\", for some production rule (α\"A\"β→αγβ) ∈ \"P\", and some context strings \"l\", \"r\" ∈ (\"N\"∪Σ).\nMore generally, \"u\" is said to yield, or derive to, \"v\", denoted as \"u\" ⇒ \"v\", if \"u\" = \"u\" ⇒ ... ⇒ \"u\" = \"v\" for some \"n\"≥0 and some strings \"u\", ..., \"u\" (\"N\"∪Σ). That is, the relation (⇒) is the reflexive transitive closure of the relation (⇒).\n\nThe language of the grammar \"G\" is the set of all terminal symbol strings derivable from its start symbol, formally: \"L\"(\"G\") = { \"w\" ∈ Σ: \"S\" ⇒ \"w\" }.\nDerivations that do not end in a string composed of terminal symbols only are possible, but don't contribute to \"L\"(\"G\").\n\nThe only difference between this definition of Chomsky and that of unrestricted grammars is that γ can be empty in the unrestricted case.\n\nSome definitions of a context-sensitive grammar only require that for any production rule of the form u → v, the length of u shall be less than or equal to the length of v. This seemingly weaker requirement is in fact weakly equivalent, see Noncontracting grammar#Transforming into context-sensitive grammar.\n\nIn addition, a rule of the form\nwhere λ represents the empty string and \"S\" does not appear on the right-hand side of any rule is permitted. The addition of the empty string allows the statement that the context sensitive languages are a proper superset of the context-free languages, rather than having to make the weaker statement that all context-free grammars with no →λ productions are also context sensitive grammars.\n\nThe name \"context-sensitive\" is explained by the α and β that form the context of \"A\" and determine whether \"A\" can be replaced with γ or not. This is different from a context-free grammar where the context of a nonterminal is not taken into consideration. Indeed, every production of a context-free grammar is of the form \"V\" → \"w\" where \"V\" is a \"single\" nonterminal symbol, and \"w\" is a string of terminals and/or nonterminals; \"w\" can be empty.\n\nIf the possibility of adding the empty string to a language is added to the strings recognized by the noncontracting grammars (which can never include the empty string) then the languages in these two definitions are identical.\n\nThe left-context- and right-context-sensitive grammars are defined by restricting the rules to just the form α\"A\" → αγ and to just \"A\"β → γβ, respectively. The languages generated by these grammars are also the full class of context-sensitive languages. The equivalence was established by Penttonen normal form.\n\nThe following grammar, with start symbol \"S\", generates the canonical non-context-free language { \"a\"\"b\"\"c\" : \"n\" ≥ 1 } :\n\nRules 1 and 2 allow for blowing-up \"S\" to \"a\"\"BC\"(\"BC\"); rules 3 to 6 allow for successively exchanging each \"CB\" to \"BC\" (four rules are needed for that since a rule \"CB\" → \"BC\" wouldn't fit into the scheme α\"A\"β → αγβ); rules 7–10 allow replacing a non-terminals \"B\" and \"C\" with its corresponding terminals \"b\" and \"c\" respectively, provided it is in the right place.\nA generation chain for \"aaabbbccc\" is:\n\nMore complicated grammars can be used to parse { \"a\"\"b\"\"c\"\"d\": \"n\" ≥ 1 }, and other languages with even more letters.\n\nA context-sensitive grammar for the language { \"a\" : i ≥ 1 } is constructed in Example 9.5 (p. 224) of (Hopcroft, Ullman, 1979).\n\nEvery context-sensitive grammar which does not generate the empty string can be transformed into a weakly equivalent one in Kuroda normal form. \"Weakly equivalent\" here means that the two grammars generate the same language. The normal form will not in general be context-sensitive, but will be a noncontracting grammar.\n\nThe Kuroda normal form is an actual normal form for non-contracting grammars.\n\nA formal language can be described by a context-sensitive grammar if and only if it is accepted by some linear bounded automaton (LBA). In some textbooks this result is attributed solely to Landweber and Kuroda. Others call it the Myhill-Landweber-Kuroda Theorem. (Myhill introduced the concept of deterministic LBA in 1960. Peter S. Landweber published in 1963 that the language accepted by a deterministic LBA is context sensitive. Kuroda introduced the notion of non-deterministic LBA and the equivalence between LBA and CSGs in 1964.)\n\nContext-sensitive languages are closed under complement. This 1988 result is known as the Immerman–Szelepcsényi theorem.\nMoreover, they are closed under union, intersection, concatenation, substitution, inverse homomorphism, and Kleene plus.\n\nEvery recursively enumerable language \"L\" can be written as \"h\"(\"L\") for some context-sensitive language \"L\" and some string homomorphism \"h\".\n\nThe decision problem that asks whether a certain string \"s\" belongs to the language of a given context-sensitive grammar \"G\", is PSPACE-complete. Morever, there are context-sensitive grammars whose languages are PSPACE-complete. In other words, there is a context-sensitive grammar \"G\" such that deciding whether a certain string \"s\" belongs to the language of \"G\" is PSPACE-complete (so \"G\" is fixed and only \"s\" is part of the input of the problem).\n\nThe emptiness problem for context-sensitive grammars (given a context-sensitive grammar \"G\", is \"L\"(\"G\")=∅ ?) is undecidable.\n\nThe LuZc parser is a working example of a program which can parse Context-sensitive grammars.\n\nSavitch has proven the following theoretical result, on which he bases his criticism of CSGs as basis for natural language: for any recursively enumerable set \"R\", there exists a context-sensitive language/grammar \"G\" which can be used as a sort of proxy to test membership in \"R\" in the following way: given a string \"s\", \"s\" is in \"R\" if and only if there exists a positive integer \"n\" for which \"sc\" is in G, where \"c\" is an arbitrary symbol not part of \"R\".\n\nIt has been shown that nearly all natural languages may in general be characterized by context-sensitive grammars, but the whole class of CSG's seems to be much bigger than natural languages. Worse yet, since the aforementioned decision problem for CSG's is PSPACE-complete, that makes them totally unworkable for practical use, as a polynomial-time algorithm for a PSPACE-complete problem would imply P=NP.\n\nIt was proven that some natural languages are not context-free, based on identifying so-called cross-serial dependencies and unbounded scrambling phenomena. However this does not necessarily imply that all the class CSG is necessary to capture \"context sensitivity\" in the colloquial sense of these terms in natural languages. For example, the strictly weaker (than CSG) linear context-free rewriting systems (LCFRS) can account for the phenomenon of cross-serial dependencies; one can write a LCFRS grammar for {\"abcd\" | \"n\" ≥ 1} for example.\n\nOngoing research on computational linguistics has focused on formulating other classes of languages that are \"mildly context-sensitive\" whose decision problems are feasible, such as tree-adjoining grammars, combinatory categorial grammars, coupled context-free languages, and linear context-free rewriting systems. The languages generated by these formalisms properly lie between the context-free and context-sensitive languages.\n\nMore recently, the class PTIME has been identified with range concatenation grammars, which are now considered to be the most expressive of the mild-context sensitive languages.\n\n\n"}

Context-sensitive is one of the four types of grammars in the Chomsky hierarchy.\n\nComputationally, a context-sensitive language is equivalent with a linear bounded nondeterministic Turing machine, also called a linear bounded automaton. That is a non-deterministic Turing machine with a tape of only \"kn\" cells, where \"n\" is the size of the input and \"k\" is a constant associated with the machine. This means that every formal language that can be decided by such a machine is a context-sensitive language, and every context-sensitive language can be decided by such a machine.\n\nThis set of languages is also known as NLINSPACE or NSPACE(\"O\"(\"n\")), because they can be accepted using linear space on a non-deterministic Turing machine. The class LINSPACE (or DSPACE(\"O\"(\"n\"))) is defined the same, except using a deterministic Turing machine. Clearly LINSPACE is a subset of NLINSPACE, but it is not known whether LINSPACE=NLINSPACE.\n\nOne of the simplest context-sensitive but not context-free languages is formula_1: the language of all strings consisting of \"n\" occurrences of the symbol \"a\", then \"n\" \"b\"'s, then \"n\" \"c\"'s (abc, aabbcc, aaabbbccc, etc.). A superset of this language, called the Bach language, is defined as the set of all strings where \"a\", \"b\" and \"c\" (or any other set of three symbols) occurs equally often (aabccb, baabcaccb, etc.) and is also context-sensitive.\n\n\"L\" can be shown to be a context-sensitive language by constructing a linear bounded automaton which accepts \"L\". The language can easily be shown to be neither regular nor context free by applying the respective pumping lemmas for each of the language classes to \"L\".\n\nAn example of recursive language that is not context-sensitive is any recursive language whose decision is an EXPSPACE-hard problem, say, the set of pairs of equivalent regular expressions with exponentiation.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6216", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6216", "title": "Chinese room", "text": "Chinese room\n\nThe Chinese room argument holds that a program cannot give a computer a \"mind\", \"understanding\" or \"consciousness\", regardless of how intelligently or human-like the program may make the computer behave. The argument was first presented by philosopher John Searle in his paper, \"Minds, Brains, and Programs\", published in \"Behavioral and Brain Sciences\" in 1980. It has been widely discussed in the years since. The centerpiece of the argument is a thought experiment known as the Chinese room.\n\nThe argument is directed against the philosophical positions of functionalism and computationalism, which hold that the mind may be viewed as an information-processing system operating on formal symbols. Specifically, the argument refutes a position Searle calls Strong AI:\nThe appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.\n\nAlthough it was originally presented in reaction to the statements of artificial intelligence (AI) researchers, it is not an argument against the goals of AI research, because it does not limit the amount of intelligence a machine can display. The argument applies only to digital computers running programs and does not apply to machines in general.\n\nSearle's thought experiment begins with this hypothetical premise: suppose that artificial intelligence research has succeeded in constructing a computer that behaves as if it understands Chinese. It takes Chinese characters as input and, by following the instructions of a computer program, produces other Chinese characters, which it presents as output. Suppose, says Searle, that this computer performs its task so convincingly that it comfortably passes the Turing test: it convinces a human Chinese speaker that the program is itself a live Chinese speaker. To all of the questions that the person asks, it makes appropriate responses, such that any Chinese speaker would be convinced that they are talking to another Chinese-speaking human being.\n\nThe question Searle wants to answer is this: does the machine \"literally\" \"understand\" Chinese? Or is it merely \"simulating\" the ability to understand Chinese? Searle calls the first position \"strong AI\" and the latter \"weak AI\".\n\nSearle then supposes that he is in a closed room and has a book with an English version of the computer program, along with sufficient paper, pencils, erasers, and filing cabinets. Searle could receive Chinese characters through a slot in the door, process them according to the program's instructions, and produce Chinese characters as output. If the computer had passed the Turing test this way, it follows, says Searle, that he would do so as well, simply by running the program manually.\n\nSearle asserts that there is no essential difference between the roles of the computer and himself in the experiment. Each simply follows a program, step-by-step, producing a behavior which is then interpreted as demonstrating intelligent conversation. However, Searle would not be able to understand the conversation. (\"I don't speak a word of Chinese,\" he points out.) Therefore, he argues, it follows that the computer would not be able to understand the conversation either.\n\nSearle argues that, without \"understanding\" (or \"intentionality\"), we cannot describe what the machine is doing as \"thinking\" and, since it does not think, it does not have a \"mind\" in anything like the normal sense of the word. Therefore, he concludes that \"strong AI\" is false.\n\nGottfried Leibniz made a similar argument in 1714 against mechanism (the position that the mind is a machine and nothing more). Leibniz used the thought experiment of expanding the brain until it was the size of a mill. Leibniz found it difficult to imagine that a \"mind\" capable of \"perception\" could be constructed using only mechanical processes. In 1974, Lawrence Davis imagined duplicating the brain using telephone lines and offices staffed by people, and in 1978 Ned Block envisioned the entire population of China involved in such a brain simulation. This thought experiment is called the China brain, also the \"Chinese Nation\" or the \"Chinese Gym\".\n\nThe Chinese Room Argument was introduced in Searle's 1980 paper \"Minds, Brains, and Programs\", published in \"Behavioral and Brain Sciences\". It eventually became the journal's \"most influential target article\", generating an enormous number of commentaries and responses in the ensuing decades, and Searle has continued to defend and refine the argument in many papers, popular articles and books. David Cole writes that \"the Chinese Room argument has probably been the most widely discussed philosophical argument in cognitive science to appear in the past 25 years\".\n\nMost of the discussion consists of attempts to refute it. \"The overwhelming majority,\" notes \"BBS\" editor Stevan Harnad, \"still think that the Chinese Room Argument is dead wrong.\" The sheer volume of the literature that has grown up around it inspired Pat Hayes to comment that the field of cognitive science ought to be redefined as \"the ongoing research program of showing Searle's Chinese Room Argument to be false\".\n\nSearle's argument has become \"something of a classic in cognitive science,\" according to Harnad. Varol Akman agrees, and has described the original paper as \"an exemplar of philosophical clarity and purity\".\n\nAlthough the Chinese Room argument was originally presented in reaction to the statements of AI researchers, philosophers have come to view it as an important part of the philosophy of mind. It is a challenge to functionalism and the computational theory of mind, and is related to such questions as the mind–body problem, the problem of other minds, the symbol-grounding problem, and the hard problem of consciousness.\n\nSearle identified a philosophical position he calls \"strong AI\":\nThe appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.\nThe definition hinges on the distinction between \"simulating\" a mind and \"actually having\" a mind. Searle writes that \"according to Strong AI, the correct simulation really is a mind. According to Weak AI, the correct simulation is a model of the mind.\"\n\nThe position is implicit in some of the statements of early AI researchers and analysts. For example, in 1955, AI founder Herbert A. Simon declared that \"there are now in the world machines that think, that learn and create\" and claimed that they had \"solved the venerable mind–body problem, explaining how a system composed of matter can have the properties of mind.\" John Haugeland wrote that \"AI wants only the genuine article: \"machines with minds\", in the full and literal sense. This is not science fiction, but real science, based on a theoretical conception as deep as it is daring: namely, we are, at root, \"computers ourselves\".\"\n\nSearle also ascribes the following positions to advocates of strong AI:\n\nIn more recent presentations of the Chinese room argument, Searle has identified \"strong AI\" as \"computer functionalism\" (a term he attributes to Daniel Dennett). Functionalism is a position in modern philosophy of mind that holds that we can define mental phenomena (such as beliefs, desires, and perceptions) by describing their functions in relation to each other and to the outside world. Because a computer program can accurately represent functional relationships as relationships between symbols, a computer can have mental phenomena if it runs the right program, according to functionalism.\n\nStevan Harnad argues that Searle's depictions of strong AI can be reformulated as \"recognizable tenets of \"computationalism\", a position (unlike \"strong AI\") that is actually held by many thinkers, and hence one worth refuting.\" Computationalism is the position in the philosophy of mind which argues that the mind can be accurately described as an information-processing system.\n\nEach of the following, according to Harnad, is a \"tenet\" of computationalism:\n\nSearle holds a philosophical position he calls \"biological naturalism\": that consciousness and understanding require specific biological machinery that is found in brains. He writes \"brains cause minds\" and that \"actual human mental phenomena [are] dependent on actual physical–chemical properties of actual human brains\". Searle argues that this machinery (known to neuroscience as the \"neural correlates of consciousness\") must have some (unspecified) \"causal powers\" that permit the human experience of consciousness. Searle's faith in the existence of these powers has been criticized.\n\nSearle does not disagree with the notion that machines can have consciousness and understanding, because, as he writes, \"we are precisely such machines\". Searle holds that the brain is, in fact, a machine, but that the brain gives rise to consciousness and understanding using machinery that is non-computational. If neuroscience is able to isolate the mechanical process that gives rise to consciousness, then Searle grants that it may be possible to create machines that have consciousness and understanding. However, without the specific machinery required, Searle does not believe that consciousness can occur.\n\nBiological naturalism implies that one cannot determine if the experience of consciousness is occurring merely by examining how a system functions, because the specific machinery of the brain is essential. Thus, biological naturalism is directly opposed to both behaviorism and functionalism (including \"computer functionalism\" or \"strong AI\"). Biological naturalism is similar to identity theory (the position that mental states are \"identical to\" or \"composed of\" neurological events); however, Searle has specific technical objections to identity theory. Searle's biological naturalism and strong AI are both opposed to Cartesian dualism, the classical idea that the brain and mind are made of different \"substances\". Indeed, Searle accuses strong AI of dualism, writing that \"strong AI only makes sense given the dualistic assumption that, where the mind is concerned, the brain doesn't matter.\"\n\nSearle's original presentation emphasized \"understanding\"—that is, mental states with what philosophers call \"intentionality\"—and did not directly address other closely related ideas such as \"consciousness\". However, in more recent presentations Searle has included consciousness as the real target of the argument.\n\nDavid Chalmers writes \"it is fairly clear that consciousness is at the root of the matter\" of the Chinese room.\n\nColin McGinn argues that the Chinese room provides strong evidence that the hard problem of consciousness is fundamentally insoluble. The argument, to be clear, is not about whether a machine can be conscious, but about whether it (or anything else for that matter) can be shown to be conscious. It is plain that any other method of probing the occupant of a Chinese room has the same difficulties in principle as exchanging questions and answers in Chinese. It is simply not possible to divine whether a conscious agency or some clever simulation inhabits the room.\n\nSearle argues that this is only true for an observer \"outside\" of the room. The whole point of the thought experiment is to put someone \"inside\" the room, where they can directly observe the operations of consciousness. Searle claims that from his vantage point within the room there is nothing he can see that could imaginably give rise to consciousness, other than himself, and clearly he does not have a mind that can speak Chinese.\n\nPatrick Hew used the Chinese Room argument to deduce requirements from military command and control systems if they are to preserve a commander's moral agency. He drew an analogy between a commander in their command center and the person in the Chinese Room, and analyzed it under a reading of Aristotle’s notions of 'compulsory' and 'ignorance'. Information could be 'down converted' from meaning to symbols, and manipulated symbolically, but moral agency could be undermined if there was inadequate 'up conversion' into meaning. Hew cited examples from the USS \"Vincennes\" incident.\n\nThe Chinese room argument is primarily an argument in the philosophy of mind, and both major computer scientists and artificial intelligence researchers consider it irrelevant to their fields. However, several concepts developed by computer scientists are essential to understanding the argument, including symbol processing, Turing machines, Turing completeness, and the Turing test.\n\nSearle's arguments are not usually considered an issue for AI research. Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig observe that most AI researchers \"don't care about the strong AI hypothesis—as long as the program works, they don't care whether you call it a simulation of intelligence or real intelligence.\" The primary mission of artificial intelligence research is only to create useful systems that \"act\" intelligently, and it does not matter if the intelligence is \"merely\" a simulation.\n\nSearle does not disagree that AI research can create machines that are capable of highly intelligent behavior. The Chinese room argument leaves open the possibility that a digital machine could be built that \"acts\" more intelligently than a person, but does not have a mind or intentionality in the same way that brains do. Indeed, Searle writes that \"the Chinese room argument ... assumes complete success on the part of artificial intelligence in simulating human cognition.\"\nSearle's \"strong AI\" should not be confused with \"strong AI\" as defined by Ray Kurzweil and other futurists, who use the term to describe machine intelligence that rivals or exceeds human intelligence. Kurzweil is concerned primarily with the \"amount\" of intelligence displayed by the machine, whereas Searle's argument sets no limit on this. Searle argues that even a super-intelligent machine would not necessarily have a mind and consciousness.\nThe Chinese room implements a version of the Turing test. Alan Turing introduced the test in 1950 to help answer the question \"can machines think?\" In the standard version, a human judge engages in a natural language conversation with a human and a machine designed to generate performance indistinguishable from that of a human being. All participants are separated from one another. If the judge cannot reliably tell the machine from the human, the machine is said to have passed the test.\n\nTuring then considered each possible objection to the proposal \"machines can think\", and found that there are simple, obvious answers if the question is de-mystified in this way. He did not, however, intend for the test to measure for the presence of \"consciousness\" or \"understanding\". He did not believe this was relevant to the issues that he was addressing. He wrote:\nTo Searle, as a philosopher investigating in the nature of mind and consciousness, these are the relevant mysteries. The Chinese room is designed to show that the Turing test is insufficient to detect the presence of consciousness, even if the room can behave or function as a conscious mind would.\n\nThe Chinese room (and all modern computers) manipulate physical objects in order to carry out calculations and do simulations. AI researchers Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon called this kind of machine a physical symbol system. It is also equivalent to the formal systems used in the field of mathematical logic.\n\nSearle emphasizes the fact that this kind of symbol manipulation is syntactic (borrowing a term from the study of grammar). The computer manipulates the symbols using a form of syntax rules, without any knowledge of the symbol's semantics (that is, their meaning).\n\nNewell and Simon had conjectured that a physical symbol system (such as a digital computer) had all the necessary machinery for \"general intelligent action\", or, as it is known today, artificial general intelligence. They framed this as a philosophical position, the physical symbol system hypothesis: \"A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means for general intelligent action.\" The Chinese room argument does not refute this, because it is framed in terms of \"intelligent action\", i.e. the external behavior of the machine, rather than the presence or absence of understanding, consciousness and mind.\n\nThe Chinese room has a design analogous to that of a modern computer. It has a Von Neumann architecture, which consists of a program (the book of instructions), some memory (the papers and file cabinets), a CPU which follows the instructions (the man), and a means to write symbols in memory (the pencil and eraser). A machine with this design is known in theoretical computer science as \"Turing complete\", because it has the necessary machinery to carry out any computation that a Turing machine can do, and therefore it is capable of doing a step-by-step simulation of any other digital machine, given enough memory and time. Alan Turing writes, \"all digital computers are in a sense equivalent.\" The widely accepted Church-Turing thesis holds that any function computable by an effective procedure is computable by a Turing machine.\n\nThe Turing completeness of the Chinese room implies that it can do whatever any other digital computer can do (albeit much, much more slowly). Thus, if the Chinese room does not or can not contain a Chinese-speaking mind, then no other digital computer can contain a mind. Some replies to Searle begin by arguing that the room, as described, cannot have a Chinese-speaking mind. Arguments of this form, according to Stevan Harnad, are \"no refutation (but rather an affirmation)\" of the Chinese room argument, because these arguments actually imply that \"no\" digital computers can have a mind.\n\nThere are some critics, such as Hanoch Ben-Yami, who argue that the Chinese room cannot simulate all the abilities of a digital computer, such as being able to determine the current time.\n\nSearle has produced a more formal version of the argument of which the Chinese Room forms a part. He presented the first version in 1984. The version given below is from 1990. The only part of the argument which should be controversial is A3 and it is this point which the Chinese room thought experiment is intended to prove.\n\nHe begins with three axioms:\n\nSearle posits that these lead directly to this conclusion:\n\nThis much of the argument is intended to show that artificial intelligence can never produce a machine with a mind by writing programs that manipulate symbols. The remainder of the argument addresses a different issue. Is the human brain running a program? In other words, is the computational theory of mind correct? He begins with an axiom that is intended to express the basic modern scientific consensus about brains and minds:\n\nSearle claims that we can derive \"immediately\" and \"trivially\" that:\n\nAnd from this he derives the further conclusions:\n\nReplies to Searle's argument may be classified according to what they claim to show:\n\nSome of the arguments (robot and brain simulation, for example) fall into multiple categories.\n\nThese replies attempt to answer the question: since the man in the room doesn't speak Chinese, \"where\" is the \"mind\" that does? These replies address the key ontological issues of mind vs. body and simulation vs. reality. All of the replies that identify the mind in the room are versions of \"the systems reply\".\n\n\nMore sophisticated versions of the systems reply try to identify more precisely what \"the system\" is and they differ in exactly how they describe it. According to these replies, the \"mind that speaks Chinese\" could be such things as: the \"software\", a \"program\", a \"running program\", a simulation of the \"neural correlates of consciousness\", the \"functional system\", a \"simulated mind\", an \"emergent property\", or \"a virtual mind\" (Marvin Minsky's version of the systems reply, described below).\n\nFrom mathematics, the theory of computation and Turing machines upholds part of the systems reply by accounting for the two computations that are known to be occurring within the room, namely (1) the computation for universal programmability (which is the function instantiated by the person and note-taking materials \"independently\" from any particular program contents) and (2) the computation of the Turing machine that is described by the program (which is instantiated by everything \"including\" the specific program). (To better see the second computation, just imagine that the program describes the algorithm for integer addition. The person would still execute their own universal computation in exactly the same automatic, rote, formal way, oblivious to this program's overall function. Yet, now we know two things: (1) the computation of integer addition is actually occurring in the room and (2) the person is not the primary thing responsible for it.)\n\nThe theory of computation thus formally explains the open possibility that the second computation in the Chinese Room could entail a human-equivalent semantic understanding of the Chinese inputs. It does not prove that such an understanding exists because the theory does not address the Turing Test. But it does show why the focus belongs on the program's Turing machine rather than on the person's.\n\n\nThese replies provide an explanation of exactly who it is that understands Chinese. If there is something \"besides\" the man in the room that can understand Chinese, Searle can't argue that (1) the man doesn't understand Chinese, therefore (2) nothing in the room understands Chinese. This, according to those who make this reply, shows that Searle's argument fails to prove that \"strong AI\" is false.\n\nHowever, the replies, by themselves, do not prove that strong AI is \"true\", either: they provide no evidence that the system (or the virtual mind) understands Chinese, other than the hypothetical premise that it passes the Turing Test. As Searle writes \"the systems reply simply begs the question by insisting that system must understand Chinese.\"\n\nAs far as the person in the room is concerned, the symbols are just meaningless \"squiggles.\" But if the Chinese room really \"understands\" what it is saying, then the symbols must get their meaning from somewhere. These arguments attempt to connect the symbols to the things they symbolize. These replies address Searle's concerns about intentionality, symbol grounding and syntax vs. semantics.\n\n\n\n\nTo each of these suggestions, Searle's response is the same: no matter how much knowledge is written into the program and no matter how the program is connected to the world, he is still in the room manipulating symbols according to rules. His actions are syntactic and this can never explain to him what the symbols stand for. Searle writes \"syntax is insufficient for semantics.\"\n\nHowever, for those who accept that Searle's actions simulate a mind, separate from his own, the important question is not what the symbols mean \"to Searle\", what is important is what they mean \"to the virtual mind.\" While Searle is trapped in the room, the virtual mind is not: it is connected to the outside world through the Chinese speakers it speaks to, through the programmers who gave it world knowledge, and through the cameras and other sensors that roboticists can supply.\n\nThese arguments are all versions of the systems reply that identify a particular \"kind\" of system as being important; they identify some special technology that would create conscious understanding in a machine. (Note that the \"robot\" and \"commonsense knowledge\" replies above also specify a certain kind of system as being important.)\n\n\n[I]magine that instead of a monolingual man in a room shuffling symbols we have the man operate an elaborate set of water pipes with valves connecting them. When the man receives the Chinese symbols, he looks up in the program, written in English, which valves he has to turn on and off. Each water connection corresponds to a synapse in the Chinese brain, and the whole system is rigged up so that after doing all the right firings, that is after turning on all the right faucets, the Chinese answers pop out at the output end of the series of pipes.\n\nNow where is the understanding in this system? It takes Chinese as input, it simulates the formal structure of the synapses of the Chinese brain, and it gives Chinese as output. But the man certainly doesn't understand Chinese, and neither do the water pipes, and if we are tempted to adopt what I think is the absurd view that somehow the conjunction of man and water pipes understands, remember that in principle the man can internalize the formal structure of the water pipes and do all the \"neuron firings\" in his imagination.\n\n\n\n\nThese arguments (and the robot or commonsense knowledge replies) identify some special technology that would help create conscious understanding in a machine. They may be interpreted in two ways: either they claim (1) this technology is required for consciousness, the Chinese room does not or cannot implement this technology, and therefore the Chinese room cannot pass the Turing test or (even if it did) it would not have conscious understanding. Or they may be claiming that (2) it is easier to see that the Chinese room has a mind if we visualize this technology as being used to create it.\n\nIn the first case, where features like a robot body or a connectionist architecture are required, Searle claims that strong AI (as he understands it) has been abandoned. The Chinese room has all the elements of a Turing complete machine, and thus is capable of simulating any digital computation whatsoever. If Searle's room can't pass the Turing test then there is no other digital technology that could pass the Turing test. If Searle's room \"could\" pass the Turing test, but still does not have a mind, then the Turing test is not sufficient to determine if the room has a \"mind\". Either way, it denies one or the other of the positions Searle thinks of as \"strong AI\", proving his argument.\n\nThe brain arguments in particular deny strong AI if they assume that there is no simpler way to describe the mind than to create a program that is just as mysterious as the brain was. He writes \"I thought the whole idea of strong AI was that we don't need to know how the brain works to know how the mind works.\" If computation does not provide an \"explanation\" of the human mind, then strong AI has failed, according to Searle.\n\nOther critics hold that the room as Searle described it does, in fact, have a mind, however they argue that it is difficult to see—Searle's description is correct, but \"misleading.\" By redesigning the room more realistically they hope to make this more obvious. In this case, these arguments are being used as appeals to intuition (see next section).\n\nIn fact, the room can just as easily be redesigned to \"weaken\" our intuitions. Ned Block's \"blockhead\" argument suggests that the program could, in theory, be rewritten into a simple lookup table of rules of the form \"if the user writes \"S\", reply with \"P\" and goto X\". At least in principle, any program can be rewritten (or \"refactored\") into this form, even a brain simulation. In the blockhead scenario, the entire mental state is hidden in the letter X, which represents a memory address—a number associated with the next rule. It is hard to visualize that an instant of one's conscious experience can be captured in a single large number, yet this is exactly what \"strong AI\" claims. On the other hand, such a lookup table would be ridiculously large (to the point of being physically impossible), and the states could therefore be \"extremely\" specific.\n\nSearle argues that however the program is written or however the machine is connected to the world, the mind is being \"simulated\" by a simple step by step digital machine (or machines). These machines are always just like the man in the room: they understand nothing and don't speak Chinese. They are merely manipulating symbols without knowing what they mean. Searle writes: \"I can have any formal program you like, but I still understand nothing.\"\n\nThe following arguments (and the intuitive interpretations of the arguments above) do not directly explain how a Chinese speaking mind could exist in Searle's room, or how the symbols he manipulates could become meaningful. However, by raising doubts about Searle's intuitions they support other positions, such as the system and robot replies. These arguments, if accepted, prevent Searle from claiming that his conclusion is obvious by undermining the intuitions that his certainty requires.\n\nSeveral critics believe that Searle's argument relies entirely on intuitions. Ned Block writes \"Searle's argument depends for its force on intuitions that certain entities do not think.\" Daniel Dennett describes the Chinese room argument as a misleading \"intuition pump\" and writes \"Searle's thought experiment depends, illicitly, on your imagining too simple a case, an irrelevant case, and drawing the 'obvious' conclusion from it.\"\n\nSome of the arguments above also function as appeals to intuition, especially those that are intended to make it seem more plausible that the Chinese room contains a mind, which can include the robot, commonsense knowledge, brain simulation and connectionist replies. Several of the replies above also address the specific issue of complexity. The connectionist reply emphasizes that a working artificial intelligence system would have to be as complex and as interconnected as the human brain. The commonsense knowledge reply emphasizes that any program that passed a Turing test would have to be \"an extraordinarily supple, sophisticated, and multilayered system, brimming with 'world knowledge' and meta-knowledge and meta-meta-knowledge\", as Daniel Dennett explains.\n\n\nAn especially vivid version of the speed and complexity reply is from Paul and Patricia Churchland. They propose this analogous thought experiment:\n\n\nStevan Harnad is critical of speed and complexity replies when they stray beyond addressing our intuitions. He writes \"Some have made a cult of speed and timing, holding that, when accelerated to the right speed, the computational may make a phase transition into the mental. It should be clear that is not a counterargument but merely an \"ad hoc\" speculation (as is the view that it is all just a matter of ratcheting up to the right degree of 'complexity.')\"\n\nSearle argues that his critics are also relying on intuitions, however his opponents' intuitions have no empirical basis. He writes that, in order to consider the \"system reply\" as remotely plausible, a person must be \"under the grip of an ideology\". The system reply only makes sense (to Searle) if one assumes that any \"system\" can have consciousness, just by virtue of being a system with the right behavior and functional parts. This assumption, he argues, is not tenable given our experience of consciousness.\n\nSeveral replies argue that Searle's argument is irrelevant because his assumptions about the mind and consciousness are faulty. Searle believes that human beings directly experience their consciousness, intentionality and the nature of the mind every day, and that this experience of consciousness is not open to question. He writes that we must \"presuppose the reality and knowability of the mental.\" These replies question whether Searle is justified in using his own experience of consciousness to determine that it is more than mechanical symbol processing. In particular, the other minds reply argues that we cannot use our experience of consciousness to answer questions about other minds (even the mind of a computer), and the epiphenomena reply argues that Searle's consciousness does not \"exist\" in the sense that Searle thinks it does.\n\n\n\nDaniel Dennett provides this extension to the \"epiphenomena\" argument.\n\nSearle disagrees with this analysis and argues that \"the study of the mind starts with such facts as that humans have beliefs, while thermostats, telephones, and adding machines don't ... what we wanted to know is what distinguishes the mind from thermostats and livers.\" He takes it as obvious that we can detect the presence of consciousness and dismisses these replies as being off the point.\n\n\nThe Chinese room argument is a central concept in Peter Watts' novels \"Blindsight\" and (to a lesser extent) \"Echopraxia\". It is also briefly mentioned in the video game Virtue's Last Reward. In Season 4 of the American crime drama \"Numb3rs\" there is a brief reference to the Chinese room.\n\nThe Chinese Room is also the name of a British independent video game development studio best known for working on experimental first-person games, such as \"Everybody's Gone to the Rapture\", or \"Dear Esther\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is the set of all points in a plane that are at a given distance from a given point, the centre; equivalently it is the curve traced out by a point that moves so that its distance from a given point is constant. The distance between any of the points and the centre is called the radius.\n\nA circle is a simple closed curve which divides the plane into two regions: an interior and an exterior. In everyday use, the term \"circle\" may be used interchangeably to refer to either the boundary of the figure, or to the whole figure including its interior; in strict technical usage, the circle is only the boundary and the whole figure is called a disc.\n\nA circle may also be defined as a special kind of ellipse in which the two foci are coincident and the eccentricity is 0, or the two-dimensional shape enclosing the most area per unit perimeter squared, using calculus of variations. \n\n\nThe word \"circle\" derives from the Greek κίρκος/κύκλος (\"kirkos/kuklos\"), itself a metathesis of the Homeric Greek κρίκος (\"krikos\"), meaning \"hoop\" or \"ring\". The origins of the words \"circus\" and \"circuit\" are closely related.\n\nThe circle has been known since before the beginning of recorded history. Natural circles would have been observed, such as the Moon, Sun, and a short plant stalk blowing in the wind on sand, which forms a circle shape in the sand. The circle is the basis for the wheel, which, with related inventions such as gears, makes much of modern machinery possible. In mathematics, the study of the circle has helped inspire the development of geometry, astronomy and calculus.\n\nEarly science, particularly geometry and astrology and astronomy, was connected to the divine for most medieval scholars, and many believed that there was something intrinsically \"divine\" or \"perfect\" that could be found in circles.\n\nSome highlights in the history of the circle are:\n\n\nThe ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter is (pi), an irrational constant approximately equal to 3.141592654. Thus the length of the circumference \"C\" is related to the radius \"r\" and diameter \"d\" by:\n\nAs proved by Archimedes, in his Measurement of a Circle, the area enclosed by a circle is equal to that of a triangle whose base has the length of the circle's circumference and whose height equals the circle's radius, which comes to multiplied by the radius squared:\n\nEquivalently, denoting diameter by \"d\",\n\nthat is, approximately 79% of the circumscribing square (whose side is of length \"d\").\n\nThe circle is the plane curve enclosing the maximum area for a given arc length. This relates the circle to a problem in the calculus of variations, namely the isoperimetric inequality.\n\nIn an \"x\"–\"y\" Cartesian coordinate system, the circle with centre coordinates (\"a\", \"b\") and radius \"r\" is the set of all points (\"x\", \"y\") such that\n\nThis equation, known as the Equation of the Circle, follows from the Pythagorean theorem applied to any point on the circle: as shown in the adjacent diagram, the radius is the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle whose other sides are of length |\"x\" − \"a\"| and |\"y\" − \"b\"|. If the circle is centred at the origin (0, 0), then the equation simplifies to\n\nThe equation can be written in parametric form using the trigonometric functions sine and cosine as\nwhere \"t\" is a parametric variable in the range 0 to 2, interpreted geometrically as the angle that the ray from (\"a\", \"b\") to (\"x\", \"y\") makes with the positive \"x\"-axis.\n\nAn alternative parametrisation of the circle is:\n\nIn this parametrisation, the ratio of \"t\" to \"r\" can be interpreted geometrically as the stereographic projection of the line passing through the centre parallel to the \"x\"-axis (see Tangent half-angle substitution). However, this parametrisation works only if t is made to range not only through all reals but also to a point at infinity; otherwise, the bottom-most point of the circle would be omitted.\n\nIn homogeneous coordinates each conic section with the equation of a circle has the form\n\nIt can be proven that a conic section is a circle exactly when it contains (when extended to the complex projective plane) the points \"I\"(1: \"i\": 0) and \"J\"(1: −\"i\": 0). These points are called the circular points at infinity.\n\nIn polar coordinates the equation of a circle is:\n\nwhere \"a\" is the radius of the circle, formula_12 is the polar coordinate of a generic point on the circle, and formula_13 is the polar coordinate of the centre of the circle (i.e., \"r\" is the distance from the origin to the centre of the circle, and \"φ\" is the anticlockwise angle from the positive \"x\"-axis to the line connecting the origin to the centre of the circle). For a circle centred at the origin, i.e. \"r\" = 0, this reduces to simply . When , or when the origin lies on the circle, the equation becomes\n\nIn the general case, the equation can be solved for \"r\", giving\nNote that without the ± sign, the equation would in some cases describe only half a circle.\n\nIn the complex plane, a circle with a centre at \"c\" and radius (\"r\") has the equation formula_16. In parametric form this can be written formula_17.\n\nThe slightly generalised equation formula_18 for real \"p\", \"q\" and complex \"g\" is sometimes called a generalised circle. This becomes the above equation for a circle with formula_19, since formula_20. Not all generalised circles are actually circles: a generalised circle is either a (true) circle or a line.\n\nThe tangent line through a point \"P\" on the circle is perpendicular to the diameter passing through \"P\". If and the circle has centre (\"a\", \"b\") and radius \"r\", then the tangent line is perpendicular to the line from (\"a\", \"b\") to (\"x\", \"y\"), so it has the form . Evaluating at (\"x\", \"y\") determines the value of \"c\" and the result is that the equation of the tangent is\nor\n\nIf then the slope of this line is\n\nThis can also be found using implicit differentiation.\n\nWhen the centre of the circle is at the origin then the equation of the tangent line becomes\nand its slope is\n\n\n\n\n\nAn inscribed angle (examples are the blue and green angles in the figure) is exactly half the corresponding central angle (red). Hence, all inscribed angles that subtend the same arc (pink) are equal. Angles inscribed on the arc (brown) are supplementary. In particular, every inscribed angle that subtends a diameter is a right angle (since the central angle is 180 degrees).\n\n\nAnother proof of this result which relies only on two chord properties given above is as follows. Given a chord of length \"y\" and with sagitta of length \"x\", since the sagitta intersects the midpoint of the chord, we know it is part of a diameter of the circle. Since the diameter is twice the radius, the \"missing\" part of the diameter is () in length. Using the fact that one part of one chord times the other part is equal to the same product taken along a chord intersecting the first chord, we find that (. Solving for \"r\", we find the required result.\n\nThere are many compass-and-straightedge constructions resulting in circles.\n\nThe simplest and most basic is the construction given the centre of the circle and a point on the circle. Place the fixed leg of the compass on the centre point, the movable leg on the point on the circle and rotate the compass.\n\n\n\nApollonius of Perga showed that a circle may also be defined as the set of points in a plane having a constant \"ratio\" (other than 1) of distances to two fixed foci, \"A\" and \"B\". (The set of points where the distances are equal is the perpendicular bisector of segment \"AB\", a line.) That circle is sometimes said to be drawn \"about\" two points.\n\nThe proof is in two parts. First, one must prove that, given two foci \"A\" and \"B\" and a ratio of distances, any point \"P\" satisfying the ratio of distances must fall on a particular circle. Let \"C\" be another point, also satisfying the ratio and lying on segment \"AB\". By the angle bisector theorem the line segment \"PC\" will bisect the interior angle \"APB\", since the segments are similar:\n\nAnalogously, a line segment \"PD\" through some point \"D\" on \"AB\" extended bisects the corresponding exterior angle \"BPQ\" where \"Q\" is on \"AP\" extended. Since the interior and exterior angles sum to 180 degrees, the angle \"CPD\" is exactly 90 degrees, i.e., a right angle. The set of points \"P\" such that angle \"CPD\" is a right angle forms a circle, of which \"CD\" is a diameter.\n\nSecond, see for a proof that every point on the indicated circle satisfies the given ratio.\n\nA closely related property of circles involves the geometry of the cross-ratio of points in the complex plane. If \"A\", \"B\", and \"C\" are as above, then the circle of Apollonius for these three points is the collection of points \"P\" for which the absolute value of the cross-ratio is equal to one:\n\nStated another way, \"P\" is a point on the circle of Apollonius if and only if the cross-ratio [\"A\",\"B\";\"C\",\"P\"] is on the unit circle in the complex plane.\n\nIf \"C\" is the midpoint of the segment \"AB\", then the collection of points \"P\" satisfying the Apollonius condition\n\nis not a circle, but rather a line.\n\nThus, if \"A\", \"B\", and \"C\" are given distinct points in the plane, then the locus of points \"P\" satisfying the above equation is called a \"generalised circle.\" It may either be a true circle or a line. In this sense a line is a generalised circle of infinite radius.\n\nIn every triangle a unique circle, called the incircle, can be inscribed such that it is tangent to each of the three sides of the triangle.\n\nAbout every triangle a unique circle, called the circumcircle, can be circumscribed such that it goes through each of the triangle's three vertices.\n\nA tangential polygon, such as a tangential quadrilateral, is any convex polygon within which a circle can be inscribed that is tangent to each side of the polygon. Every regular polygon and every triangle is a tangential polygon.\n\nA cyclic polygon is any convex polygon about which a circle can be circumscribed, passing through each vertex. A well-studied example is the cyclic quadrilateral. Every regular polygon and every triangle is a cyclic polygon. A polygon that is both cyclic and tangential is called a bicentric polygon.\n\nA hypocycloid is a curve that is inscribed in a given circle by tracing a fixed point on a smaller circle that rolls within and tangent to the given circle.\n\nThe circle can be viewed as a limiting case of each of various other figures:\n\nSquaring the circle is the problem, proposed by ancient geometers, of constructing a square with the same area as a given circle by using only a finite number of steps with compass and straightedge.\n\nIn 1882, the task was proven to be impossible, as a consequence of the Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem which proves that pi () is a transcendental number, rather than an algebraic irrational number; that is, it is not the root of any polynomial with rational coefficients.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6221", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6221", "title": "Cardinal (Catholic Church)", "text": "Cardinal (Catholic Church)\n\nA cardinal (, literally \"Cardinal of the Holy Roman Church\") is a senior ecclesiastical leader, considered a Prince of the Church, and usually (now always for those created when still within the voting age-range) an ordained bishop of the Roman Catholic Church. The cardinals of the Church are collectively known as the College of Cardinals. The duties of the cardinals include attending the meetings of the College and making themselves available individually or in groups to the Pope as requested. Most have additional duties, such as leading a diocese or archdiocese or managing a department of the Roman Curia. A cardinal's primary duty is electing the bishop of Rome when the see becomes vacant. During the \"sede vacante\" (the period between a pope's death or resignation and the election of his successor), the day-to-day governance of the Holy See is in the hands of the College of Cardinals. The right to enter the conclave of cardinals where the pope is elected is limited to those who have not reached the age of 80 years by the day the vacancy occurs.\n\nIn 1059, the right of electing the pope was reserved to the principal clergy of Rome and the bishops of the seven suburbicarian sees. In the 12th century the practice of appointing ecclesiastics from outside Rome as cardinals began, with each of them assigned a church in Rome as his titular church or linked with one of the suburbicarian dioceses, while still being incardinated in a diocese other than that of Rome.\n\nThe term \"cardinal\" at one time applied to any priest permanently assigned or incardinated to a church, or specifically to the senior priest of an important church, based on the Latin \"cardo\" (hinge), meaning \"principal\" or \"chief\". The term was applied in this sense as early as the ninth century to the priests of the \"tituli\" (parishes) of the diocese of Rome. The Church of England retains an instance of this origin of the title, which is held by the two senior members of the College of Minor Canons of St Paul's Cathedral. We\n\nThere is disagreement about the origin of the term, but general consensus that \"\"cardinalis\"\" from the word \"cardo\" (meaning 'pivot' or 'hinge') was first used in late antiquity to designate a bishop or priest who was incorporated into a church for which he had not originally been ordained. In Rome the first persons to be called cardinals were the deacons of the seven regions of the city at the beginning of the 6th century, when the word began to mean \"principal,\" \"eminent,\" or \"superior.\" The name was also given to the senior priest in each of the \"title\" churches (the parish churches) of Rome and to the bishops of the seven sees surrounding the city. By the 8th century the Roman cardinals constituted a privileged class among the Roman clergy. They took part in the administration of the church of Rome and in the papal liturgy. By decree of a synod of 769, only a cardinal was eligible to become bishop of Rome. In 1059, during the pontificate of Nicholas II, cardinals were given the right to elect the bishop of Rome under the Papal Bull \"In nomine Domini\". For a time this power was assigned exclusively to the cardinal bishops, but the Third Lateran Council in 1179 gave back the right to the whole body of cardinals. Cardinals were granted the privilege of wearing the red hat by Pope Innocent IV in 1244.\n\nIn cities other than Rome, the name cardinal began to be applied to certain church men as a mark of honour. The earliest example of this occurs in a letter sent by Pope Zacharias in 747 to Pippin III (the Short), ruler of the Franks, in which Zacharias applied the title to the priests of Paris to distinguish them from country clergy. This meaning of the word spread rapidly, and from the 9th century various episcopal cities had a special class among the clergy known as cardinals. The use of the title was reserved for the cardinals of Rome in 1567 by Pius V.\n\nIn the year 1563 the influential Ecumenical Council of Trent, headed by Pope Pius IV, wrote about the importance of selecting good Cardinals. According to this historic council \"nothing is more necessary to the Church of God than that the holy Roman pontiff apply that solicitude which by the duty of his office he owes the universal Church in a very special way by associating with himself as cardinals the most select persons only, and appoint to each church most eminently upright and competent shepherds; and this the more so, because our Lord Jesus Christ will require at his hands the blood of the sheep of Christ that perish through the evil government of shepherds who are negligent and forgetful of their office.\"\n\nThe earlier influence of temporal rulers, notably the French kings, reasserted itself through the influence of cardinals of certain nationalities or politically significant movements. Traditions even developed entitling certain monarchs, including those of Austria, Spain, and Portugal, to nominate one of their trusted clerical subjects to be created cardinal, a so-called \"crown-cardinal\".\n\nIn early modern times, cardinals often had important roles in secular affairs. In some cases, they took on powerful positions in government. In Henry VIII's England, his chief minister was Cardinal Wolsey. Cardinal Richelieu's power was so great that he was for many years effectively the ruler of France. Richelieu's successor was also a cardinal, Jules Mazarin. Guillaume Dubois and André-Hercule de Fleury complete the list of the \"four great\" cardinals to have ruled France. In Portugal, due to a succession crisis, one cardinal, Henry, King of Portugal, was crowned king, the only example of a cardinal-king.\n\nPope Sixtus V limited the number of cardinals to 70, comprising six cardinal bishops, 50 cardinal priests, and 14 cardinal deacons. Starting in the pontificate of Pope John XXIII, that limit has been exceeded. At the start of 1971, Pope Paul VI set the number of cardinal electors at a maximum of 120, but set no limit on the number of cardinals generally. He also established a maximum age of eighty years for electors. His action deprived twenty-five living cardinals, including the three living cardinals elevated by Pope Pius XI, of the right to participate in a conclave. Popes can dispense from church laws and have sometimes brought the number of cardinals under the age of 80 to more than 120. Pope Paul VI also increased the number of cardinal bishops by giving that rank to patriarchs of the Eastern Catholic Churches.\n\nEach cardinal takes on a titular church, either a church in the city of Rome or one of the suburbicarian sees. The only exception is for patriarchs of Eastern Catholic Churches. Nevertheless, cardinals possess no power of governance nor are they to intervene in any way in matters which pertain to the administration of goods, discipline, or the service of their titular churches. They are allowed to celebrate Mass and hear confessions and lead visits and pilgrimages to their titular churches, in coordination with the staff of the church. They often support their churches monetarily, and many Cardinals do keep in contact with the pastoral staffs of their titular churches.\n\nThe Dean of the College of Cardinals in addition to such a titular church also receives the titular bishopric of Ostia, the primary suburbicarian see. Cardinals governing a particular Church retain that church.\n\nIn 1630, Pope Urban VIII decreed their title to be \"Eminence\" (previously, it had been \"illustrissimo\" and \"reverendissimo\") and decreed that their secular rank would equate to Prince, making them secondary only to the Pope and crowned monarchs.\n\nIn accordance with tradition, they sign by placing the title \"Cardinal\" (abbreviated \"Card.\") after their personal name and before their surname as, for instance, \"John Card(inal) Doe\" or, in Latin, \"Ioannes Card(inalis) Cognomen\". Some writers, such as James-Charles Noonan, hold that, in the case of cardinals, the form used for signatures should be used also when referring to them in English. Official sources such as the Archdiocese of Milwaukee and Catholic News Service say that the correct form for referring to a cardinal in English is normally as \"Cardinal [First name] [Surname]\". This is the rule given also in stylebooks not associated with the Catholic Church. This style is also generally followed on the websites of the Holy See and episcopal conferences. Oriental Patriarchs who are created Cardinals customarily use \"Sanctae Ecclesiae Cardinalis\" as their full title, probably because they do not belong to the Roman clergy.\n\nIn Latin, on the other hand, the [First name] Cardinal [Surname] order is used in the proclamation of the election of a new pope by the cardinal protodeacon: \"\"Annuntio vobis gaudium magnum; habemus Papam: Eminentissimum ac Reverendissimum Dominum, Dominum (first name) Sanctae Romanae Ecclesiae Cardinalem (last name), ...\"\" (Meaning: \"I announce to you a great joy; we have a Pope: The Most Eminent and Most Reverend Lord, Lord (first name) Cardinal of the Holy Roman Church (last name), ...\") This assumes that the new pope had been a cardinal just before becoming pope; the most recent election of a non-cardinal as pope was in 1378.\n\nWhile the incumbents of some sees are regularly made cardinals, and some countries are entitled to at least one cardinal by concordate (usually earning its primate the cardinal's hat), no see carries an actual right to the cardinalate, not even if its bishop is a Patriarch.\n\nCardinal bishops (cardinals of the episcopal order) are among the most senior prelates of the Catholic Church. Though in modern times most cardinals are also bishops, the term \"cardinal bishop\" only refers to the cardinals who are titular bishops of one of the seven suburbicarian sees.\n\nIn early times, the privilege of papal election was not reserved to the cardinals, and for centuries the person elected was customarily a Roman priest and never a bishop from elsewhere. To preserve apostolic succession the rite of consecrating him a bishop had to be performed by someone who was already a bishop. The rule remains that, if the person elected Pope is not yet a bishop, he is consecrated by the Dean of the College of Cardinals, the Cardinal Bishop of Ostia.\n\nThere are seven suburbicarian sees: Ostia, Albano, Porto and Santa Rufina, Palestrina, Sabina and Mentana, Frascati, and Velletri. Velletri was united with Ostia from 1150 until 1914, when Pope Pius X separated them again, but decreed that whichever cardinal bishop became Dean of the College of Cardinals would keep the suburbicarian see he already held, adding to it that of Ostia, with the result that there continued to be only six cardinal bishops.\n\nSince 1962, the cardinal bishops have only a titular relationship with the suburbicarian sees, with no powers of governance over them. Each see has its own bishop, with the exception of Ostia, of which the Cardinal Vicar of the see of Rome serves as apostolic administrator.\n\nThe current cardinal bishops of the suburbicarian dioceses are given in the table below. Those highlighted in red (which, as of June 10, 2017, is all of them) are ineligible to participate in a Papal conclave.\n\nFor a period ending in the mid-20th century, long-serving cardinal priests were entitled to fill vacancies that arose among the cardinal bishops, just as cardinal deacons of ten years' standing are still entitled to become cardinal priests. Since then, cardinals have been advanced to cardinal bishop exclusively by papal appointment. Those appointed to be cardinal-bishops are usually already cardinals, but their seniority within the order of cardinal bishops is determined by the date of their elevation to the order of cardinal bishop, rather than by the date they originally became cardinals of a lesser order.\n\nThe Dean of the College of Cardinals, or Cardinal-dean, is the \"primus inter pares\" of the College of Cardinals, elected by the cardinal bishops holding suburbicarian sees from among their own number, an election, however, that must be approved by the Pope. Formerly the position of dean belonged by right to the longest-serving of the cardinal bishops. The Vice-Dean is similarly elected by the six suburbicarian cardinal bishops from among their own number with the Pope's approval and formerly belonged by right to the second-longest-serving of the cardinal bishops.\n\nIn 1965, Pope Paul VI decreed in his \"motu proprio\" \"Ad Purpuratorum Patrum Collegium\" that patriarchs of the Eastern Catholic Churches who were named cardinals (i.e., patriarch cardinals) would also be part of the episcopal order, ranking after the six cardinal bishops of the suburbicarian sees (who had been relieved of direct responsibilities for those sees by Pope John XXIII three years earlier). Patriarch cardinals do not receive title of a suburbicarian see, and as such they cannot elect the dean or become dean. There are currently three Eastern Patriarchs who are cardinal bishops:\n\nIf a Latin Rite titular patriarch (notably of Venice or Lisbon) is made a cardinal, he ranks as a cardinal priest, not as a cardinal bishop.\n\nCardinal priests are the most numerous of the three orders of cardinals in the Catholic Church, ranking above the cardinal deacons and below the cardinal bishops. Those who are named cardinal priests today are generally bishops of important dioceses throughout the world, though some hold Curial positions.\n\nIn modern times, the name \"cardinal priest\" is interpreted as meaning a cardinal who is of the order of priests. Originally, however, this referred to certain key priests of important churches of the Diocese of Rome, who were recognized as the \"cardinal\" priests, the important priests chosen by the pope to advise him in his duties as Bishop of Rome (the Latin \"cardo\" means \"hinge\"). Certain clerics in many dioceses at the time, not just that of Rome, were said to be the key personnel—the term gradually became exclusive to Rome to indicate those entrusted with electing the bishop of Rome, the pope.\nWhile the cardinalate has long been expanded beyond the Roman pastoral clergy and Roman Curia, every cardinal priest has a titular church in Rome, though they may be bishops or archbishops elsewhere, just as cardinal bishops are given one of the suburbicarian dioceses around Rome. Pope Paul VI abolished all administrative rights cardinals had with regard to their titular churches, though the cardinal's name and coat of arms are still posted in the church, and they are expected to celebrate mass and preach there if convenient when they are in Rome.\n\nWhile the number of cardinals was small from the times of the Roman Empire to the Renaissance, and frequently smaller than the number of recognized churches entitled to a cardinal priest, in the 16th century the College expanded markedly. In 1587, Pope Sixtus V sought to arrest this growth by fixing the maximum size of the College at 70, including 50 cardinal priests, about twice the historical number. This limit was respected until 1958, and the list of titular churches modified only on rare occasions, generally when a building fell into disrepair. When Pope John XXIII abolished the limit, he began to add new churches to the list, which Popes Paul VI and John Paul II continued to do. Today there are close to 150 titular churches, out of over 300 churches in Rome.\n\nThe cardinal who is the longest-serving member of the order of cardinal priests is titled \"cardinal protopriest\". He had certain ceremonial duties in the conclave that have effectively ceased because he would generally have already reached age 80, at which cardinals are barred from the conclave. The current cardinal protopriest is Michael Michai Kitbunchu of Thailand.\n\nThe cardinal deacons are the lowest-ranking cardinals. Cardinals elevated to the diaconal order are either officials of the Roman Curia or priests elevated after their 80th birthday. Bishops with diocesan responsibilities, however, are created cardinal priests.\n\nCardinal deacons derive originally from the seven deacons in the Papal Household and the seven deacons who supervised the Church's works in the districts of Rome during the early Middle Ages, when church administration was effectively the government of Rome and provided all social services. Cardinal deacons are given title to one of these deaconries.\n\nCardinals elevated to the diaconal order are mainly officials of the Roman Curia holding various posts in the church administration. Their number and influence has varied through the years. While historically predominantly Italian the group has become much more internationally diverse in later years. While in 1939 about half were Italian by 1994 the number was reduced to one third. Their influence in the election of the Pope has been considered important, they are better informed and connected than the dislocated cardinals but their level of unity has been varied. Under the 1587 decree of Pope Sixtus V, which fixed the maximum size of the College of Cardinals, there were 14 cardinal deacons. Later the number increased. As late as 1939 almost half of the cardinals were members of the curia. Pius XII reduced this percentage to 24 percent. John XXIII brought it back up to 37 percent but Paul VI brought it down to 27 percent where John Paul II maintained this ratio.\n\nAs of 2005, there were over 50 churches recognized as cardinalatial deaconries, though there were only 30 cardinals of the order of deacons. Cardinal deacons have long enjoyed the right to \"opt for the order of cardinal priests\" (\"optazione\") after they have been cardinal deacons for 10 years. They may on such elevation take a vacant \"title\" (a church allotted to a cardinal priest as the church in Rome with which he is associated) or their diaconal church may be temporarily elevated to a cardinal priest's \"title\" for that occasion. When elevated to cardinal priests, they take their precedence according to the day they were first made cardinal deacons (thus ranking above cardinal priests who were elevated to the college after them, regardless of order).\n\nWhen not celebrating Mass but still serving a liturgical function, such as the semiannual \"Urbi et Orbi\" papal blessing, some Papal Masses and some events at Ecumenical Councils, cardinal deacons can be recognized by the dalmatics they would don with the simple white mitre (so called \"mitra simplex\").\n\nThe cardinal protodeacon, the senior cardinal deacon in order of appointment to the College of Cardinals, has the privilege of announcing a new pope's election and name (once he has been ordained to the episcopate) from the central balcony of St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City. In the past, during papal coronations, the proto-deacon also had the honor of bestowing the pallium on the new pope and crowning him with the papal tiara. However, in 1978 Pope John Paul I chose not to be crowned and opted for a simpler papal inauguration ceremony, and his three successors followed that example. As a result, the cardinal protodeacon's privilege of crowning a new pope has effectively ceased although it could be revived if a future pope were to restore a coronation ceremony. However, the proto-deacon still has the privilege of bestowing the pallium on a new pope at his papal inauguration. \"Acting in the place of the Roman Pontiff, he also confers the pallium upon metropolitan bishops or gives the pallium to their proxies.\" The current cardinal proto-deacon is Renato Raffaele Martino.\n\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>Ceased to be protodeacon upon being raised to the order of cardinal-priest\n<br>†Was protodeacon at time of death\n\nThe Cardinal Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church, assisted by the Vice-Camerlengo and the other prelates of the office known as the Apostolic Camera, has functions that in essence are limited to a period of \"sede vacante\" of the papacy. He is to collate information about the financial situation of all administrations dependent on the Holy See and present the results to the College of Cardinals, as they gather for the papal conclave.\n\nUntil 1917, it was possible for someone who was not a priest, but only in minor orders, to become a cardinal (see \"lay cardinals\", below), but they were enrolled only in the order of cardinal deacons. For example, in the 16th century, Reginald Pole was a cardinal for 18 years before he was ordained a priest. In 1917 it was established that all cardinals, even cardinal deacons, had to be priests, and, in 1962, Pope John XXIII set the norm that all cardinals be ordained as bishops, even if they are only priests at the time of appointment. As a consequence of these two changes, canon 351 of the 1983 Code of Canon Law requires that a cardinal be at least in the order of priesthood at his appointment, and that those who are not already bishops must receive episcopal consecration. Several cardinals aged over 80 or close to it when appointed have obtained dispensation from the rule of having to be a bishop. These were all appointed cardinal-deacons, but Roberto Tucci and Albert Vanhoye lived long enough to exercise the right of option and be promoted to the rank of cardinal-priest.\n\nA cardinal who is not a bishop is still entitled to wear and use the episcopal vestments and other pontificalia (episcopal regalia: mitre, crozier, zucchetto, pectoral cross and ring). Even if not a bishop, any cardinal has both actual and honorary precedence over non-cardinal patriarchs, as well as the archbishops and bishops who are not cardinals, but he cannot perform the functions reserved solely to bishops, such as ordination. The prominent priests who since 1962 were not ordained bishops on their elevation to the cardinalate were over the age of 80 or near to it, and so no cardinal who was not a bishop has participated in recent papal conclaves.\n\nAt various times, there have been cardinals who had only received first tonsure and minor orders but not yet been ordained as deacons or priests. Though clerics, they were inaccurately called \"lay cardinals\". Teodolfo Mertel was among the last of the lay cardinals. When he died in 1899 he was the last surviving cardinal who was not at least ordained a priest. With the revision of the Code of Canon Law promulgated in 1917 by Pope Benedict XV, only those who are already priests or bishops may be appointed cardinals. Since the time of Pope John XXIII a priest who is appointed a cardinal must be consecrated a bishop, unless he obtains a dispensation.\n\nIn addition to the named cardinals, the pope may name secret cardinals or cardinals \"in pectore\" (Latin for \"in the breast\").\n\nDuring the Western Schism, many cardinals were created by the contending popes. Beginning with the reign of Pope Martin V, cardinals were created without publishing their names until later, termed \"creati et reservati in pectore\".\n\nA cardinal named \"in pectore\" is known only to the pope; not even the cardinal so named is necessarily aware of his elevation, and in any event cannot function as a cardinal while his appointment is \"in pectore\". Today, cardinals are named \"in pectore\" to protect them or their congregations from reprisals if their identities were known.\n\nIf conditions change, so that the pope judges it safe to make the appointment public, he may do so at any time. The cardinal in question then ranks in precedence with those raised to the cardinalate at the time of his \"in pectore\" appointment. If a pope dies before revealing the identity of an \"in pectore\" cardinal, the cardinalate expires.\n\nOf the 232 cardinals that Pope John Paul II elevated, four were named \"in pectore\". The identities of three of these were subsequently revealed:\n\nWhen in choir dress, a Latin-rite cardinal wears scarlet garments — the blood-like red symbolizes a cardinal's willingness to die for his faith. Excluding the rochet — which is always white — the scarlet garments include the cassock, mozzetta, and biretta (over the usual scarlet zucchetto). The biretta of a cardinal is distinctive not merely for its scarlet color, but also for the fact that it does not have a pompon or tassel on the top as do the birettas of other prelates. Until the 1460s, it was customary for cardinals to wear a violet or blue cape unless granted the privilege of wearing red when acting on papal business. His normal-wear cassock is black but has scarlet piping and a scarlet fascia (sash). Occasionally, a cardinal wears a scarlet \"ferraiolo\" which is a cape worn over the shoulders, tied at the neck in a bow by narrow strips of cloth in the front, without any 'trim' or piping on it. It is because of the scarlet color of cardinals' vesture that the bird of the same name has become known as such.\n\nEastern Catholic cardinals continue to wear the normal dress appropriate to their liturgical tradition, though some may line their cassocks with scarlet and wear scarlet fascias, or in some cases, wear Eastern-style cassocks entirely of scarlet.\n\nIn previous times, at the consistory at which the pope named a new cardinal, he would bestow upon him a distinctive wide-brimmed hat called a galero. This custom was discontinued in 1969 and the investiture now takes place with the scarlet biretta. In ecclesiastical heraldry, however, the scarlet galero is still displayed on the cardinal's coat of arms. Cardinals had the right to display the galero in their cathedral, and when a cardinal died, it would be suspended from the ceiling above his tomb. Some cardinals will still have a galero made, even though it is not officially part of their apparel.\n\nTo symbolize their bond with the papacy, the pope gives each newly appointed cardinal a gold ring, which is traditionally kissed by Catholics when greeting a cardinal (as with a bishop's episcopal ring). Before the new uniformity imposed by John Paul II, each cardinal was given a ring, the central piece of which was a gem, usually a sapphire, with the pope's stemma engraved on the inside. There is now no gemstone, and the pope chooses the image on the outside: under Pope Benedict XVI it was a modern depiction of the crucifixion of Jesus, with Mary and John to each side. The ring includes the pope's coat of arms on the inside.\n\nCardinals have in canon law a \"privilege of forum\" (i.e., exemption from being judged by ecclesiastical tribunals of ordinary rank): only the pope is competent to judge them in matters subject to ecclesiastical jurisdiction (cases that refer to matters that are spiritual or linked with the spiritual, or with regard to infringement of ecclesiastical laws and whatever contains an element of sin, where culpability must be determined and the appropriate\necclesiastical penalty imposed). The pope either decides the case himself or delegates the decision to a tribunal, usually one of the tribunals or congregations of the Roman Curia. Without such delegation, no ecclesiastical court, even the Roman Rota, is competent to judge a canon law case against a cardinal.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6225", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6225", "title": "Cantigas de Santa Maria", "text": "Cantigas de Santa Maria\n\nThe Cantigas de Santa Maria (\"Canticles of Holy Mary\"; ), , are 420 poems with musical notation, written in the Medieval Galician language during the reign of Alfonso X \"El Sabio\" (1221–1284) and often attributed to him.\n\nIt is one of the largest collections of monophonic (solo) songs from the Middle Ages and is characterized by the mention of the Virgin Mary in every song, while every tenth song is a hymn.\n\nThe \"Cantigas\" have survived in four manuscript codices: two at El Escorial, one at Madrid's National Library, and one in Florence, Italy. The E codex from El Escorial is illuminated with colored miniatures showing pairs of musicians playing a wide variety of instruments. The \"Códice Rico\" (T) from El Escorial and the one in the Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale of Florence (F) are richly illuminated with narrative vignettes.\n\nThe Cantigas are written in Galician-Portuguese, fashionable as a lyrical language in Castile at the time. The Cantigas are composed of 420 poems, 356 of which are in a narrative format relating to Marian miracles; the rest of them, except an introduction and two prologues, are of \"lore\" or involve Marian festivities. The Cantigas depict the Virgin Mary in a very humanized way, often having her play a role in earthly episodes.\n\nThe authors are unknown, although several studies have suggested that Galician poet Airas Nunes might have been the author of a large number of the Cantiga poems. King Alfonso X — named as Affonso in the Cantigas — is also believed to be an author of some of them as he refers himself in first person. Support for this theory can be found in the prologue of the Cantigas. Also, many sources credit Alfonso owing to his influence on other works within the poetic tradition, including his introduction on religious song. Although King Alfonso X's authorship is debatable, his influence is not. While the other major works that came out of Alfonso's workshops, including histories and other prose texts, were in Castilian, the Cantigas are in Galician-Portuguese, and reflect the popularity in the Castilian court of other poetic corpuses such as the cantigas d'amigo and cantigas d'amor.\nThe metrics are extraordinarily diverse: 280 different formats for the 420 Cantigas. The most common are the \"virelai\" and the \"rondeau\". The length of the lines varies between two and 24 syllables. The narrative voice in many of the songs describes an erotic relationship, in the troubadour fashion, with the Divine.\nThe music is written in notation which is similar to that used for chant, but also contains some information about the length of the notes. Several transcriptions exist. The Cantigas are frequently recorded and performed by Early Music groups, and quite a few CDs featuring music from the Cantigas are available.\n\nThe Cantigas are preserved in four manuscripts: \"To\" (\"códice de Toledo,\" Biblioteca Nacional de España, MS 10069), \"T\" (Biblioteca de El Escorial, MS T.I.1), \"F\" (\"códice de Florencia,\" Florence, Biblioteca Nazionale, MS b.r. 20) and \"E\" (\"códice de los músicos,\" Biblioteca de El Escorial MS B.I.2). \"E\" contains the largest number of songs (406 Cantigas, plus the Introduction and the Prologue); it contains 41 carefully detailed miniatures and many illuminated letters. \"To\" is the earliest collection and contains 129 songs. Although not illustrated, it is richly decorated with pen flourished initials, and great care has been taken over its construction. The \"T\" and \"F\" manuscripts are sister volumes. \"T\" contains 195 surviving cantigas (8 are missing due to loss of folios) which roughly correspond in order to the first two hundred in \"E\", each song being illustrated with either 6 or 12 miniatures that depict scenes from the cantiga. \"F\" follows the same format but has only 111 cantigas, of which 7 have no text, only miniatures. These are basically a subset of those found in the second half of \"E\", but are presented here in a radically different order. \"F\" was never finished, and so no music was ever added. Only the empty staves display the intention to add musical notation to the codex at a later date. It is generally thought that the codices were constructed during Alfonso's lifetime, \"To\" perhaps in the 1270s, and \"T\"/\"F\" and \"E\" in the early 1280s up until the time of his death in 1284.\n\nThe musical forms within the Cantigas, and there are many, are still being studied. There have been many false leads, and there is little beyond pitch value that is very reliable. Mensuration is a particular problem in the Cantigas, and most attempts at determining meaningful rhythmic schemes have tended, with some exceptions, to be unsatisfactory. This remains a lively topic of debate and study. Progress, while on-going, has nevertheless been significant over the course of the last 20 years.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6226", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6226", "title": "Claudio Monteverdi", "text": "Claudio Monteverdi\n\nClaudio Giovanni Antonio Monteverdi (; 15 May 1567 (baptized) – 29 November 1643) was an Italian composer, string player and choirmaster. A composer of both secular and church music, and a pioneer in the development of opera, he is considered a crucial transitional figure between the Renaissance and the Baroque periods of music history.\n\nBorn in Cremona, where he undertook his first musical studies and compositions, Monteverdi developed his career first at the court of Mantua (c. 1590–1613) and then until his death in the Venetian Republic where he was \"maestro di capella\" at the basilica of San Marco. His surviving letters give insight into the life of a professional musician in Italy of the period, including problems of income, patronage and politics.\n\nMuch of Monteverdi's output, including many stage works, has been lost. His surviving music includes nine books of madrigals, large-scale sacred works such as his \"Vespro della Beata Vergine\" (\"Vespers\") of 1610, and three complete operas. His opera \"L'Orfeo\" (1607) is the earliest of the genre still widely performed; towards the end of his life he wrote works for the commercial theatre in Venice, including \"Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria\" and \"L'incoronazione di Poppea\".\nWhile he worked extensively in the tradition of earlier Renaissance polyphony, such as in his madrigals, he undertook great developments in form and melody, and began to employ the basso continuo technique, distinctive of the Baroque. No stranger to controversy, he defended his sometimes novel techniques as elements of a \"seconda pratica\", contrasting with the more orthodox earlier style which he termed the \"prima pratica\". Largely forgotten during the eighteenth and much of the nineteenth centuries, his works enjoyed a rediscovery around the beginning of the twentieth century. He is now established both as a significant influence in European musical history and as a composer whose works are regularly performed and recorded.\n\nMonteverdi is usually described as an \"Italian\" composer, even though in his lifetime the concept of \"Italy\" existed only as a geographical entity. Although the inhabitants of the peninsula shared much in common in terms of history, culture and language, in political terms the people experienced various layers of (mostly foreign) authority and jurisdiction. In the first instance they were subject to the local rulers of their city-states, powerful families such as the Gonzagas and the Medicis. Above them were the imperial powers – in the sixteenth century primarily Spain – and also the authority of the Habsburgs of Vienna, in their role as Holy Roman Emperors, guardians of the Catholic faith.\n\nMonteverdi was baptised in the church of SS Nazaro e Celso, Cremona, on 15 May 1567. The register records his name as \"Claudio Zuan Antonio\" the son of \"Messer Baldasar Mondeverdo\". He was the first child of the apothecary Baldassare Monteverdi and his first wife Maddalena (née Zignani); they had married early the previous year. Claudio's brother Giulio Cesare Monteverdi (b. 1573) was also to become a musician; there were two other brothers and two sisters from Baldassare's marriage to Maddalena and his subsequent marriage in 1576 or 1577. Cremona lay under the jurisdiction of Milan, a Spanish possession, so that Monteverdi was technically born a Spanish subject. Cremona was close to the border of the Venetian Republic, and not far from the lands controlled by Mantua, in both of which states Monteverdi was later to establish his career.\n\nThere is no clear record of Monteverdi's early musical training, or evidence that (as is sometimes claimed) he was a member of the Cathedral choir or studied at Cremona University. Monteverdi's first published work, a set of motets, \" (Sacred Songs)\" for three voices, was issued in Venice in 1582, when he was only fifteen years old. In this, and his other initial publications, he describes himself as the pupil of Marc'Antonio Ingegneri, who was from 1581 (and possibly from 1576) to 1592 the \"maestro di cappella\" at Cremona Cathedral. The musicologist Tim Carter deduces that Ingegneri \"gave him a solid grounding in counterpoint and composition\", and that Monteverdi would also have studied playing instruments of the viol family and singing.\n\nMonteverdi's first publications also give evidence of his connections beyond Cremona, even in his early years. His second published work, \"Madrigali spirituali\" (Spiritual Madrigals, 1583), was printed at Brescia. His next works (his first published secular compositions) were sets of five-part madrigals, according to his biographer Paolo Fabbri \"the inevitable proving ground for any composer of the second half of the sixteenth century ... the secular genre \"par excellence\"\". The first book of madrigals (Venice,1587) was dedicated to Count Marco Verità of Verona; the second book of madrigals (Venice, 1590) was dedicated to the President of the Senate of Milan, Giacomo Ricardi, for whom he had played the viola da braccio in 1587.\n\n In the dedication of his second book of madrigals, Monteverdi had described himself as a player of the \"vivuola\" (which could mean either viola da gamba or viola da braccio). In 1590 or 1591 he entered the service of Duke Vincenzo I Gonzaga of Mantua; he recalled in his dedication to the Duke of his third book of madrigals (Venice, 1592) that \"the most noble exercise of the \"vivuola\" opened to me the fortunate way into your service.\" In the same dedication he compares his instrumental playing to \"flowers\" and his compositions as \"fruit\" which as it matures \"can more worthily and more perfectly serve you\", indicating his intentions to establish himself as a composer.\n\nDuke Vincenzo was keen to establish his court as a musical centre, and sought to recruit leading musicians. When Monteverdi arrived in Mantua, the \"maestro di capella\" at the court was the Flemish musician Giaches de Wert. Other notable musicians at the court during this period included the composer and violinist Salomone Rossi, Rossi's sister the singer Madama Europa, and the tenor Francesco Rasi. Monteverdi married the court singer Claudia de Cattaneis in 1599; they were to have three children, two sons (Francesco, b. 1601 and Massimiliano, b. 1604), and a daughter who died soon after birth in 1603. Monteverdi's brother Giulio Cesare joined the court musicians in 1602.\n\nWhen Wert died in 1596, his post was given to Benedetto Pallavicino, but Monteverdi was clearly highly regarded by Vincenzo and accompanied him on his military campaigns in Hungary (1595) and also on a visit to Flanders in 1599. Here at the town of Spa he is reported by his brother Giulio Cesare as encountering, and bringing back to Italy, the \"canto alla francese\". (The meaning of this, literally \"song in the French style\", is debatable, but may refer to the French-influenced poetry of Gabriello Chiabrera, some of which was set by Monteverdi in his \"Scherzi musicali\", and which departs from the traditional Italian style of lines of 9 or 11 syllables). Monteverdi may possibly have been a member of Vincenzo's entourage at Florence in 1600 for the marriage of Maria de' Medici and Henry IV of France, at which celebrations Jacopo Peri's opera \"Euridice\" (the earliest surviving opera) was premiered. On the death of Pallavicino in 1601 Monteverdi was confirmed as the new \"maestro di capella\".\n\nAt the turn of the 17th century, Monteverdi found himself the target of musical controversy. The influential Bolognese theorist Giovanni Maria Artusi attacked Monteverdi's music (without naming the composer) in his work \"L'Artusi, overo Delle imperfettioni della moderna musica (Artusi, or On the imperfections of modern music)\" of 1600, followed by a sequel in 1603. Artusi cited extracts from Monteverdi's works not yet published (they later formed parts of his fourth and fifth books of madrigals of 1603 and 1605), condemning their use of harmony and their innovations in use of musical modes, compared to orthodox polyphonic practice of the sixteenth century. Artusi attempted to correspond with Monteverdi on these issues; the composer refused to respond, but found a champion in a pseudonymous supporter, \"L'Ottuso Academico\" (\"The Obtuse Academic\"). Eventually Monteverdi replied in the preface to the fifth book of madrigals that his duties at court prevented him from a detailed reply; but in a note to \"the studious reader\", he claimed that he would shortly publish a response, \"Seconda Pratica, overo Perfettione della Moderna Musica (The Second Style, or Perfection of Modern Music).\" This work never appeared, but a later publication by Claudio's brother Giulio Cesare made it clear that the \"seconda pratica\" which Monteverdi defended was not seen by him as radical change or his own invention, but was an evolution from previous styles (\"prima pratica\") which was complementary to them.\n\nThis debate seems in any case to have raised the composer's profile, leading to reprints of his earlier books of madrigals. Some of his madrigals were published in Copenhagen in 1605 and 1606, and the poet Tommaso Stigliani published a eulogy of him in his 1605 poem \"O sirene de' fiumi\". The composer of madrigal comedies and theorist Adriano Banchieri wrote in 1609: \"I must not neglect to mention the most noble of composers, Monteverdi ... his expressive qualities are truly deserving of the highest commendation, and we find in them countless examples of matchless declamation ... enhanced by comparable harmonies.\" The modern music historian Massimo Ossi has placed the Artusi issue in the context of Monteverdi's artistic development: \"If the controversy seems to define Monteverdi's historical position, it also seems to have been about stylistic developments that by 1600 Monteverdi had already outgrown\".\n\nThe non-appearance of Monteverdi's promised explanatory treatise may have been a deliberate ploy, since by 1608, by Monteverdi's reckoning, Artusi had become fully reconciled to modern trends in music, and the \"seconda pratica\" was by then well established; Monteverdi had no need to revisit the issue. On the other hand, letters to Giovanni Battista Doni of 1632 show that Monteverdi was still preparing a defence of the \"seconda practica\", in a treatise entitled \"Melodia\"; he may still have been working on this at the time of his death ten years later.\n\nIn 1606 Vincenzo's heir Francesco commissioned from Monteverdi the opera \"L'Orfeo\", to a libretto by Alessandro Striggio, for the Carnival season of 1607. It was given two performances in February and March 1607; the singers included, in the title role, Rasi, who had sung in the first performance of \"Euridice\" witnessed by Vincenzo in 1600. This was followed in 1608 by the opera \"L'Arianna\" (libretto by Ottavio Rinuccini), intended for the celebration of the marriage of Francesco to Margherita of Savoy. All the music for this opera is lost apart from \"Ariadne's Lament\", which became extremely popular. To this period also belongs the ballet entertainment \"Il ballo delle ingrate\".\n\nThe strain of the hard work Monteverdi had been putting into these and other compositions was exacerbated by personal tragedies. His wife died in September 1607 and the young singer Caterina Martinelli, intended for the title role of \"Arianna\", died of smallpox in March 1608. Monteverdi also resented his increasingly poor financial treatment by the Gonzagas. He retired to Cremona in 1608 to convalesce, and wrote a bitter letter to Vincenzo's minister Annibale Chieppio in November of that year seeking (unsuccessfully) \"an honourable dismissal\". Although the Duke increased Monteverdi's salary and pension, and Monteverdi returned to continue his work at the court, he began to seek patronage elsewhere. After publishing his \"Vespers\" in 1610, which were dedicated to Pope Paul V, he visited Rome, ostensibly hoping to place his son Francesco at a seminary, but apparently also seeking alternative employment. In the same year he may also have visited Venice, where a large collection of his church music was being printed, with a similar intention.\n\nDuke Vincenzo died on 18 February 1612. When Francesco succeeded him, court intrigues and cost-cutting let to the dismissal of Monteverdi and his brother Giulio Cesare, who both returned, almost penniless, to Cremona. Despite Francesco's own death from smallpox in December 1612, Monteverdi was unable to return to favour with his successor, his brother Cardinal Ferdinando Gonzaga. In 1613, following the death of Giulio Cesare Martinengo, Monteverdi auditioned for his post as \"maestro\" at the basilica of San Marco in Venice, for which he submitted music for a Mass. He was appointed in August 1613, and given 50 ducats for his expenses (of which he was robbed, together with his other belongings, by highwaymen at Sanguinetto on his return to Cremona).\n\nMartinengo had been ill for some time before his death and had left the music of San Marco in a fragile state. The choir had been neglected and the administration overlooked. When Monteverdi arrived to take up his post, his principal responsibility was to recruit, train, discipline and manage the musicians of San Marco (the \"capella\"), who amounted to about 30 singers and six instrumentalists; the numbers could be increased for major events. Among the recruits to the choir was Francesco Cavalli, who joined in 1616 at the age of 14; he was to remain connected with San Marco throughout his life, and was to develop a close association with Monteverdi. Monteverdi also sought to expand the repertory, including not only the traditional \"a cappella\" repertoire of Roman and Flemish composers, but also examples of the modern style which he favoured, including the use of continuo and other instruments. Apart from this he was of course expected to compose music for all the major feasts of the church. This included a new mass each year for Holy Cross Day and Christmas Eve, cantatas in honour of the Venetian Doge, and numerous other works (many of which are lost). Monteverdi was also free to obtain income by providing music for other Venetian churches and for other patrons, and was frequently commissioned to provide music for state banquets. The Procurators of San Marco, to whom Monteverdi was directly responsible, showed their satisfaction with his work in 1616 by raising his annual salary from 300 ducats to 400.\n\nThe relative freedom which the Republic of Venice afforded him, compared to the problems of court politics in Mantua, are reflected in Monteverdi's letters to Striggio, particularly his letter of 13 March 1620, when he rejects an invitation to return to Mantua, extolling his present position and finances in Venice, and referring to the pension which Mantua still owes him. Nonetheless, remaining a Mantuan citizen, he accepted commissions from the new Duke Ferdinando, who had formally renounced his position as Cardinal in 1616 to take on the duties of state. These included the \"balli\" \"Tirsi e Clori\" (1616) and \"Apollo\" (1620), an opera \"Andromeda\" (1620) and an \"intermedio\", \"Le nozze di Tetide\", for the marriage of Ferdinando with Caterina de' Medici (1617). Most of these compositions were extensively delayed in creation – partly, as shown by surviving correspondence, through the composer's unwillingness to prioritise them, and partly because of constant changes in the court's requirements. They are now lost, apart from \"Tirsi e Clori\", which was included in the seventh book of madrigals (published 1619) and dedicated to the Duchess Caterina, for which the composer received a pearl necklace from the Duchess. A subsequent major commission, the opera \"La finta pazza Licori\", to a libretto by Giulio Strozzi, was completed for Fernando's successor Vincenzo II, who succeeded to the dukedom in 1626. Because of the latter's illness (he died in 1627), it was never performed, and it is now also lost.\n\nMonteverdi also received commissions from other Italian states and from their communities in Venice. These included, for the Milanese community in 1620, music for the Feast of St. Charles Borromeo, and for the Florentine community a Requiem Mass for Cosimo II de' Medici (1621). Monteverdi acted on behalf of Paolo Giordano II, Duke of Bracciano, to arrange publication of works by the Cremona musician Francesco Petratti. Among Monteverdi's private Venetian patrons was the nobleman Girolamo Mocenigo, at whose home was premiered in 1624 the dramatic entertainment \"Il combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda\" based on an episode from Torquato Tasso's \"La Gerusalemme liberata\". In 1627 Monteverdi received a major commission from Odoardo Farnese, Duke of Parma, for a series of works, and gained leave from the Procurators to spend time there during 1627 and 1628.\n\nMonteverdi's musical direction received the attention of foreign visitors. The Dutch diplomat and musician Constantijn Huygens, attending a Vespers service at the church of SS. Giovanni and Lucia, wrote that he \"heard the most perfect music I had ever heard in my life. It was directed by the most famous Claudio Monteverdi ... who was also the composer and was accompanied by four theorbos, two cornettos, two bassoons, one \"basso de viola\" of huge size, organs and other instruments ...\". Monteverdi wrote a mass, and provided other musical entertainment, for the visit to Venice in 1625 of the Crown Prince Władysław of Poland, who may have sought to revive attempts made a few years previously to lure Monteverdi to Warsaw. He also provided chamber music for Wolfgang Wilhelm, Count Palatine of Neuburg, when the latter was paying an incognito visit to Venice in July 1625.\n\nCorrespondence of Monteverdi in 1625 and 1626 with the Mantuan courtier Ercole Marigliani reveals an interest in alchemy, which apparently Monteverdi had taken up as a hobby. He discusses experiments to transform lead into gold, the problems of obtaining mercury, and mentions commissioning special vessels for his experiments from the glassworks at Murano.\n\nDespite his generally satisfactory situation in Venice, Monteverdi experienced personal problems from time to time. He was on one occasion – probably because of his wide network of contacts – the subject of an anonymous denunciation to the Venetian authorities alleging that he supported the Habsburgs. He was also subject to anxieties about his children. His son Francesco, while a student of law at Padua in 1619, was spending in Monteverdi's opinion too much time with music, and he therefore moved him to Bologna University. This did not have the required result, and it seems that Monteverdi resigned himself to Francesco having a musical career – he joined the choir of San Marco in 1623. His other son Massimiliano, who graduated in medicine, was arrested by the Inquisition in Mantua in 1627 for reading forbidden literature. Monteverdi was obliged to sell the necklace he had received from Duchess Caterina to pay for his son's (eventually successful) defence. Monteverdi wrote at the time to Striggio seeking his help, and fearing that Massimiliano might be subject to torture; it seems that Striggio's intervention was helpful. Money worries at this time also led Monteverdi to visit Cremona to secure for himself a church canonry.\n\nA series of disturbing events troubled Monteverdi's world in the period around 1630. Mantua was invaded by Habsburg armies in 1630, who besieged the plague-stricken town, and after its fall in July looted its treasures, and dispersed the artistic community. The plague was carried to Mantua's ally Venice by an embassy led by Monteverdi's confidante Striggio, and over a period of 16 months led to over 45,000 deaths, leaving Venice's population in 1633 at just above 100,000, the lowest level for about 150 years. Among the plague victims was Monteverdi's assistant at San Marco, and a notable composer in his own right, Alessandro Grandi. The plague and the after-effects of war had an inevitable deleterious effect on the economy and artistic life of Venice. Monteverdi's younger brother Giulio Cesare also died at this time, probably from the plague.\n\nBy this time Monteverdi was in his sixties, and his rate of composition seems to have slowed down. He had written a setting of Strozzi's \"Proserpina rapita (The Abduction of Proserpina)\", now lost except for one vocal trio, for a Mocenigo wedding in 1630, and produced a Mass for deliverance from the plague for San Marco which was performed in November 1631. His set of \"Scherzi musicali\" was published in Venice in 1632. In 1631, Monteverdi was admitted to the tonsure, and was ordained deacon, and later priest, in 1632. Although these ceremonies took place in Venice, he was nominated as a member of the clergy of Cremona; this may imply that he intended to retire there.\n\nThe opening of the opera house of San Cassiano in 1637, the first public opera house in Europe, stimulated the city's musical life and coincided with a new burst of the composer's activity. 1638 saw the publication of Monteverdi's eighth book of madrigals and a revision of the \"Ballo delle ingrate\". The eighth book contains a \"ballo\", \"Volgendi il ciel\", which may have been composed for the Holy Roman Emperor, Ferdinand III, to whom the book is dedicated. The years 1640–1641 saw the publication of the extensive collection of church music, \"Selva morale e spirituale\". Among other commissions, Monteverdi wrote music in 1637 and 1638 for Strozzi's \"Accademia degli Unisoni\" in Venice, and in 1641 a ballet, \"La vittoria d'Amore\", for the court of Piacenza.\n\nMonteverdi was still not entirely free from his responsibilities for the musicians at San Marco. He wrote to complain about one of his singers to the Procurators, on 9 June 1637: \"I, Claudio Monteverdi ... come humbly ... to set forth to you how Domenicato Aldegati ... a bass, yesterday morning ... at the time of the greatest concourse of people ... spoke these exact words ...'The Director of Music comes from a brood of cut-throat bastards, a thieving, fucking, he-goat ... and I shit on him and whoever protects him ...\n\nMonteverdi's contribution to opera at this period is notable. He revised his earlier opera \"L'Arianna\" in 1640 and wrote three new works for the commercial stage, \"Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria (The Return of Ulysses to his Homeland\", 1640, first performed in Bologna with Venetian singers), \"Le nozze d'Enea e Lavinia (The Marriage of Aeneas and Lavinia\", 1641, music now lost), and \"L'incoronazione di Poppea\" (\"The Coronation of Poppea\", 1643). The introduction to the printed scenario of \"Le nozze d'Enea\", by an unknown author, acknowledges that Monteverdi is to be credited for the rebirth of theatrical music and that \"he will be sighed for in later ages, for his compositions will surely outlive the ravages of time.\"\n\nIn his last surviving letter (20 August 1643), Monteverdi, already ill, was still hoping for the settlement of the long-disputed pension from Mantua, and asked the Doge of Venice to intervene on his behalf. He died in Venice on 29 November 1643, after paying a brief visit to Cremona, and is buried in the Church of the Frari. He was survived by his sons; Masimilliano died in 1661, Francesco after 1677.\n\n\nThere is a consensus among music historians that a period extending from the mid-15th century to around 1625, characterised in Lewis Lockwood's phrase by \"substantial unity of outlook and language\", should be identified as the period of \"Renaissance music\". Musical literature has also defined the succeeding period (covering music from approximately 1580 to 1750) as the era of \"Baroque music\". It is in the late-16th to early-17th-century overlap of these periods that much of Monteverdi's creativity flourished; he stands as a transitional figure between the Renaissance and the Baroque.\n\nIn the Renaissance era, music had developed as a formal discipline, a \"pure science of relationships\" in the words of Lockwood. In the Baroque era it became a form of aesthetic expression, increasingly used to adorn religious, social and festive celebrations in which, in accordance with Plato's ideal, the music was subordinated to the text. Solo singing with instrumental accompaniment, or monody, acquired greater significance towards the end of the 16th century, replacing polyphony as the principal means of dramatic music expression. This was the changing world in which Monteverdi was active. Percy Scholes in his \"Oxford Companion to Music\" describes the \"new music\" thus: \"[Composers] discarded the choral polyphony of the madrigal style as barbaric, and set dialogue or soliloquy for single voices, imitating more or less the inflexions of speech and accompanying the voice by playing mere supporting chords. Short choruses were interspersed, but they too were homophonic rather than polyphonic.\"\n\nIngegneri, Monteverdi's first tutor, was a master of the \"musica reservata\" vocal style, which involved the use of chromatic progressions and word-painting; Monteverdi's early compositions were grounded in this style. Ingegneri was a traditional Renaissance composer, \"something of an anachronism\" according to Arnold, but Monteverdi also studied the work of more \"modern\" composers such as Luca Marenzio, Luzzasco Luzzaschi, and a little later, Giaches de Wert, from whom he would learn the art of expressing passion. He was a precocious and productive student, as indicated by his youthful publications of 1582–83. Paul Ringer writes that \"these teenaged efforts reveal palpable ambition matched with a convincing mastery of contemporary style\", but at this stage they display their creator's competence rather than any striking originality. Geoffrey Chew classifies them as \"not in the most modern vein for the period\", acceptable but out-of-date. Chew rates the \"Canzonette\" collection of 1584 much more highly than the earlier juvenilia: \"These brief three-voice pieces draw on the airy, modern style of the villanellas of Marenzio, [drawing on] a substantial vocabulary of text-related madrigalisms\".\n\nThe canzonetta form was much used by composers of the day as a technical exercise, and is a prominent element in Monteverdi's first book of madrigals published in 1587. In this book, the playful, pastoral settings again reflect the style of Marenzio, while Luzzaschi's influence is evident in Monteverdi's use of dissonance. The second book (1590) begins with a setting modelled on Marenzio of a modern verse, Torquato Tasso's \"Non si levav' ancor\", and concludes with a text from 50 years earlier: Pietro Bembo's \"Cantai un tempo\". Monteverdi set the latter to music in an archaic style reminiscent of the long-dead Cipriano de Rore. Between them is \"Ecco mormorar l'onde\", strongly influenced by de Wert and hailed by Chew as the great masterpiece of the second book.\n\nA thread common throughout these early works is Monteverdi's use of the technique of \"imitatio\", a general practice among composers of the period whereby material from earlier or contemporary composers was used as models for their own work. Monteverdi continued to use this procedure well beyond his apprentice years, a factor that in some critics' eyes has compromised his reputation for originality.\n\nMonteverdi's first fifteen years of service in Mantua are bracketed by his publications of the third book of Madrigals in 1592 and the fourth and fifth books in 1603 and 1605. Between 1592 and 1603 he made minor contributions to other anthologies. How much he composed in this period is a matter of conjecture; his many duties in the Mantuan court may have limited his opportunities, but several of the madrigals that he published in the fourth and fifth books were written and performed during the 1590s, some figuring prominently in the Artusi controversy.\nThe third book shows strongly the increased influence of Wert, by that time Monteverdi's direct superior as \"maestro de capella\" at Mantua. Two poets dominate the collection: Tasso, whose lyrical poetry had figured prominently in the second book but is here represented through the more epic, heroic verses from \"Gerusalemme liberata\", and Giovanni Battista Guarini, whose verses had appeared sporadically in Monteverdi's earlier publications, but form around half of the contents of the third book. Wert's influence is reflected in Monteverdi's forthrightly modern approach, and his expressive and chromatic settings of Tasso's verses. Of the Guarini settings Chew writes: \"The epigrammatic style ... closely matches a poetic and musical ideal of the period ... [and] often depends on strong, final cadential progressions, with or without the intensification provided by chains of suspended dissonances\". Chew cites the setting of \"Stracciami pur il core\" as \"a prime example of Monteverdi's irregular dissonance practice\". Tasso and Guarini were both regular visitors to the Mantuan court; Monteverdi's association with them and his absorption of their ideas may have helped lay the foundations of his own approach to the musical dramas that he would create a decade later.\n\nAs the 1590s progressed, Monteverdi moved closer towards the form that he would identify in due course as the \"seconda pratica\". Claude V. Palisca quotes the madrigal \"Ohimè, se tanto amate\", published in the fourth book but written before 1600 – it is among the works attacked by Artusi – as a typical example of the composer's developing powers of invention. In this madrigal Monteverdi again departs from the established practice in the use of dissonance, by means of a vocal ornament Palisca describes as \"échappé\". Monteverdi's daring use of this device is, says Palisca, \"like a forbidden pleasure\". In this and in other settings the poet's images were supreme, even at the expense of musical consistency.\n\nThe fourth book includes madrigals to which Artusi objected on the grounds of their \"modernism\". However, Ossi describes it as \"an anthology of disparate works firmly rooted in the 16th century\", closer in nature to the third book than to the fifth. There is evidence of the composer's familiarity with the works of Carlo Gesualdo, and with composers of the school of Ferrara such as Luzzaschi; the book was dedicated to a Ferrarese musical society, the \"Accademici Intrepidi\".\n\nThe fifth book looks more to the future; for example, Monteverdi employs the \"concertato\" style with basso continuo (a device that was to become a typical feature in the emergent Baroque era), and includes a \"sinfonia\" (instrumental interlude) in the final piece. He presents his music through complex counterpoint and daring harmonies, although at times combining the expressive possibilities of the new music with traditional polyphony.\n\nIn Monteverdi's final five years' service in Mantua he completed the operas \"L'Orfeo\" (1607) and \"L'Arianna\" (1608), and wrote quantities of sacred music including the \"Messa in illo tempore\" (1610) and also the collection known as \"Vespro della Beata Vergine\" which is often referred to as \"Monteverdi's \"Vespers\"\" (1610). He also published \"Scherzi musicale a tre voci\" (1607), settings of verses composed since 1599 and dedicated to the Gonzago heir, Francesco. The vocal trio in the \"Scherzi\" comprises two sopranos and a bass, accompanied by simple instrumental ritornellos. According to Bowers the music \"reflected the modesty of the prince's resources; it was, nevertheless, the earliest publication to associate voices and instruments in this particular way\".\n\nThe opera opens with a brief trumpet toccata. The prologue of La musica (a figure representing music) is introduced with a ritornello by the strings, repeated often to represent the \"power of music\" – one of the earliest examples of an operatic leitmotif. Act 1 presents a pastoral idyll, the buoyant mood of which continues into Act 2. The confusion and grief which follow the news of Euridice's death are musically reflected by harsh dissonances and the juxtaposition of keys. The music remains in this vein until the act ends with the consoling sounds of the ritornello.\n\nAct 3 is dominated by Orfeo's aria \"Possente spirto e formidabil nume\" by which he attempts to persuade Caronte to allow him to enter Hades. Monteverdi's vocal embellishments and virtuoso accompaniment provide what Tim Carter has described as \"one of the most compelling visual and aural representations\" in early opera. In Act 4 the warmth of Proserpina's singing on behalf of Orfeo is retained until Orfeo fatally \"looks back\". The brief final act, which sees Orfeo's rescue and metamorphosis, is framed by the final appearance of the ritornello and by a lively moresca that brings the audience back to their everyday world.\n\nThroughout the opera Monteverdi makes innovative use of polyphony, extending the rules beyond the conventions which composers normally observed in fidelity to Palestrina. He combines elements of the traditional 16th-century madrigal with the new monodic style where the text dominates the music and sinfonias and instrumental ritornellos illustrate the action.\n\nThe music for this opera is lost except for the \"Lamento d'Arianna\", which was published in the sixth book in 1614 as a five-voice madrigal; a separate monodic version was published in 1623. In its operatic context the lament depicts Arianna's various emotional reactions to her abandonment: sorrow, anger, fear, self-pity, desolation and a sense of futility. Throughout, indignation and anger are punctuated by tenderness, until a descending line brings the piece to a quiet conclusion.\n\nThe musicologist Suzanne Cusick writes that Monteverdi \"creat[ed] the lament as a recognizable genre of vocal chamber music and as a standard scene in opera ... that would become crucial, almost genre-defining, to the full-scale public operas of 17th-century Venice\". Cusick observes how Monteverdi is able to match in music the \"rhetorical and syntactical gestures\" in the text of Ottavio Rinuccini. The opening repeated words \"Lasciatemi morire\" (Let me die) are accompanied by a dominant seventh chord which Ringer describes as \"an unforgettable chromatic stab of pain\". Ringer suggests that the lament defines Monteverdi's innovative creativity in a manner similar to that in which the Prelude and the Liebestod in \"Tristan und Isolde\" announced Wagner's discovery of new expressive frontiers.\n\nRinuccini's full libretto, which has survived, was set in modern times by Alexander Goehr (\"Arianna\", 1995), including a version of Monteverdi's \"Lament\".\n\nThe \"Vespro della Beata Vergine\", Monteverdi's first published sacred music since the \"Madrigali spirituali\" of 1583, consists of 14 components: an introductory versicle and response, five psalms interspersed with five \"sacred concertos\" (Monteverdi's term), a hymn, and two Magnificat settings. Collectively these pieces fulfil the requirements for a Vespers service on any feast day of the Virgin. Monteverdi employs many musical styles; the more traditional features, such as cantus firmus, falsobordone and Venetian canzone, are mixed with the latest madrigal style, including echo effects and chains of dissonances. Some of the musical features used are reminiscent of \"L'Orfeo\", written slightly earlier for similar instrumental and vocal forces.\n\nIn this work the \"sacred concertos\" fulfil the role of the antiphons which divide the psalms in regular Vespers services. Their non-liturgical character has led writers to question whether they should be within the service, or indeed whether this was Monteverdi's intention. In some versions of Monteverdi's \"Vespers\" (for example, those of Denis Stevens) the concertos are replaced with antiphons associated with the Virgin, although John Whenham in his analysis of the work argues that the collection as a whole should be regarded as a single liturgical and artistic entity.\n\nAll the psalms, and the Magnificat, are based on melodically limited and repetitious Gregorian chant psalm tones, around which Monteverdi builds a range of innovative textures. This concertato style challenges the traditional cantus firmus, and is most evident in the \"Sonata sopra Sancta Maria\", written for eight string and wind instruments plus basso continuo, and a single soprano voice. Monteverdi uses modern rhythms, frequent metre changes and constantly varying textures; yet, according to John Eliot Gardiner, \"for all the virtuosity of its instrumental writing and the evident care which has gone into the combinations of timbre\", Monteverdi's chief concern was resolving the proper combination of words and music.\n\nThe actual musical ingredients of the Vespers were not novel to Mantua – concertato had been used by Lodovico Grossi da Viadana, a former choirmaster at the cathedral of Mantua, while the \"Sonata sopra\" had been anticipated by Archangelo Crotti in his \"Sancta Maria\" published in 1608. It is, writes Denis Arnold, Monteverdi's mixture of the various elements that makes the music unique. Arnold adds that the Vespers achieved fame and popularity only after their 20th-century rediscovery; they were not particularly regarded in Monteverdi's time.\n\nDuring his years in Venice Monteverdi published his sixth (1614), seventh (1619) and eighth (1638) books of madrigals. The sixth book consists of works written before the composer's departure from Mantua. Hans Redlich sees it as a transitional work, containing Monteverdi's last madrigal compositions in the manner of the \"prima pratica\", together with music which is typical of the new style of expression which Monteverdi had displayed in the dramatic works of 1607–08. The central theme of the collection is loss; the best-known work is the five-voice version of \"Lamento d'Arianna\", which, says Massimo Ossi, gives \"an object lesson in the close relationship between monodic recitative and counterpoint\". The book contains Monteverdi's first settings of verses by Giambattista Marino, and two settings of Petrarch which Ossi considers the most extraordinary pieces in the volume, providing some \"stunning musical moments\".\n\nWhile Monteverdi had looked backwards in the sixth book, he moved forward in the seventh book from the traditional concept of the madrigal, and from monody, in favour of chamber duets. There are exceptions, such the two solo \"lettere amorose\" (love letters) \"Se i languidi miei sguardi\" and \"Se pur destina e vole\", written to be performed \"genere rapresentativo\" – acted as well as sung. Of the duets which are the main features of the volume, Chew highlights \"Ohimé, dov'è il mio ben, dov'è il mio core\", a romanesca in which two high voices express dissonances above a repetitive bass pattern. The book also contains large-scale ensemble works, and the ballet \"Tirsi e Clori\". This was the height of Monteverdi's \"Marino period\"; six of the pieces in the book are settings of the poet's verses. As Carter puts it, Monteverdi \"embraced Marino's madrigalian kisses and love-bites with ... the enthusiasm typical of the period\". Some commentators have opined that the composer should have had better poetic taste.\n\nThe eighth book, subtitled \"Madrigali guerrieri, et amorosi ...\" (\"Madrigals of war and love\") is structured in two symmetrical halves, one for \"war\" and one for \"love\". Each half begins with a six-voice setting, followed by an equally large-scale Petrarch setting, then a series of duets mainly for tenor voices, and concludes with a theatrical number and a final ballet. The \"war\" half contains several items written as tributes to the emperor Ferdinand III who had succeeded to the Habsburg throne in 1637. Many of Monteverdi's familiar poets – Giulio Strozzi, Rinuccini, Tasso, Marino, Guarini – are represented in the settings.\n\nIt is difficult to gauge when many of the pieces were composed, although the ballet \"Mascherata dell' ingrate\" that ends the book dates back to 1608 and the celebration of the Gonzaga-Savoy marriage. The \"Combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda\", centrepiece of the \"war\" settings, had been written and performed in Venice in 1624; on its publication in the eighth book, Monteverdi explicitly linked it to his concept of \"concitato genera\" (otherwise \"stile concitato\" – \"aroused style\") that would \"fittingly imitate the utterance and the accents of a brave man who is engaged in warfare\", and implied that since he had originated this style, others had begun to copy it. The work employed for the first time instructions for the use of pizzicato string chords, and also evocations of fanfares and other sounds of combat.\n\nThe critic Andrew Clements describes the eighth book as \"a statement of artistic principles and compositional authority\", in which Monteverdi \"shaped and expanded the madrigal form to accommodate what he wanted to do ... the pieces collected in Book Eight make up a treasury of what music in the first half the 17th century could possibly express.\"\n\nDuring this period of his Venetian residency Monteverdi composed quantities of sacred music. Numerous motets and other short works were included in anthologies by local publishers such as Giulio Cesare Bianchi (a former student of Monteverdi) and Lorenzo Calvi, and others were published elsewhere in Italy and Austria. The range of styles in the motets is broad, from simple strophic arias with string accompaniment to full-scale declamations with an alleluia finale.\n\nMonteverdi retained emotional and political attachments to the Mantuan court and wrote for it, or undertook to write, large amounts of stage music including at least four operas. The ballet \"Tirsi e Clori\" survives through its inclusion in the seventh book, but the rest of the Mantuan dramatic music is lost. Many of the missing manuscripts may have disappeared in the wars that overcame Mantua in 1630. The most significant aspect of their loss, according to Carter, is the extent to which they might have provided musical links between Monteverdi's early Mantuan operas and those he wrote in Venice after 1638: \"Without these links ... it is hard to a produce a coherent account of his development as a composer for the stage\". Likewise, Janet Beat regrets that the 30-year gap hampers the study of how opera orchestration developed during those critical early years.\n\nApart from the madrigal books, Monteverdi's only published collection during this period was the volume of \"Scherzi musicale\" in 1632. For unknown reasons, the composer's name does not appear on the inscription, the dedication being signed by the Venetian printer Bartolemeo Magni; Carter surmises that the recently ordained Monteverdi may have wished to keep his distance from this secular collection. It mixes strophic continuo songs for solo voice with more complex works which employ continuous variation over repeated bass patterns. Chew selects the chaconne for two tenors, \"Zefiro torna e di soavi accenti\", as the outstanding item in the collection: \"[T]he greater part of this piece consists of repetitions of a bass pattern which ensures tonal unity of a simple kind, owing to its being framed as a simple cadence in a G major tonal type: over these repetitions, inventive variations unfold in virtuoso passage-work\".\n\n\"Main articles\": \"Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria\"; \"L'incoronazione di Poppea\"; \"Selva morale e spirituale\"\n\nThe last years of Monteverdi's life were much occupied with opera for the Venetian stage. Richard Taruskin, in his \"Oxford History of Western Music\", gives his chapter on this topic the title \"Opera from Monteverdi to Monteverdi.\" This wording, originally proposed humorously by the Italian music historian Nino Pirrotta, is interpreted seriously by Taruskin as indicating that Monteverdi is significantly responsible for the transformation of the opera genre from a private entertainment of the nobility (as with \"Orfeo\" in 1607), to what became a major commercial genre, as exemplified by his opera \"L'incoronazione di Poppea\" (1643). His two surviving operatic works of this period, \"Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria\" and \"L'incoronazione\" are held by Arnold to be the first \"modern\" operas; \"Il ritorno\" is the first Venetian opera to depart from what Ellen Rosand terms \"the mythological pastoral\". However, David Johnson in \"The North American Review\" warns audiences not to expect immediate affinity with Mozart, Verdi or Puccini: \"You have to submit yourself to a much slower pace, to a much more chaste conception of melody, to a vocal style that is at first merely like dry declamation and only on repeated hearings begins to assume an extraordinary eloquence.\"\n\n\"Il ritorno\", says Carter, is clearly influenced by Monteverdi's earlier works. Penelope's lament in Act I is close in character to the lament from \"L'Arianna\", while the martial episodes recall \"Il combattimento\". \"Stile concitato\" is prominent in the fight scenes and in the slaying of Penelope's suitors. In \"L'incoronazione\", Monteverdi represents moods and situations by specific musical devices: triple metre stands for the language of love; arpeggios demonstrate conflict; \"stile concitato\" represents rage. There is continuing debate about how much of the extant \"L'incoronazione\" music is Monteverdi's original, and how much is the work of others (there are, for instance, traces of music by Francesco Cavalli).\n\nThe \"Selva morale e spirituale\" of 1641, and the posthumous \"Messa et salmi\" published in 1650 (which was edited by Cavalli), are selections of the sacred music that Monteverdi wrote for San Marco during his 30-year tenure – much else was likely written but not published. The \"Selva morale\" volume opens with a series of madrigal settings on moral texts, dwelling on themes such as \"the transitory nature of love, earthly rank and achievement, even existence itself\". They are followed by a Mass in conservative style (\"stile antico\"), the high point of which is an extended seven-voice \"Gloria\". Scholars believe that this might have been written to celebrate the end of the 1631 plague. The rest of the volume is made up of numerous psalm settings, two Magnificats and three \"Salve Reginas\". The \"Messa et salmi\" volume includes a \"stile antico\" Mass for four voices, a polyphonic setting of the psalm \"Laetatus Sum\", and a version of the Litany of Lareto that Monteverdi had originally published in 1620.\n\nThe posthumous ninth book of madrigals was published in 1651, a miscellany dating back to the early 1630s, some items being repeats of previously published pieces, such as the popular duet \"O sia tranquillo il mare\" from 1638. The book includes a trio for three sopranos, \"Come dolce oggi l'auretta\", which is the only surviving music from the 1630 lost opera \"Proserpina rapita\".\n\n In his lifetime Monteverdi enjoyed considerable status among musicians and the public. This is evidenced by the scale of his funeral rites: \"[W]ith truly royal pomp a catafalque was erected in the Chiesa de Padrini Minori de Frari, decorated all in mourning, but surrounded with so many candles that the church resembled a night sky luminous with stars\". This glorification was transitory; Carter writes that in Monteverdi's day, music rarely survived beyond the circumstances of its initial performance and was quickly forgotten along with its creator. In this regard Monteverdi fared better than most. His operatic works were revived in several cities in the decade following his death; according to Severo Bonini writing in 1651, every musical household in Italy possessed a copy of the \"Lamento d'Arianna\".\n\nThe German composer Heinrich Schütz, who had studied in Venice under Giovanni Gabrieli shortly before Monteverdi's arrival there, possessed a copy of \"Il combattimento\" and himself took up elements of the \"stile concitato\". On his second visit to Venice in 1628–1629, Arnold believes, Schütz absorbed the concepts of \"basso continuo\" and expressiveness of word-setting, but he opines that Schütz was more directly influenced by the style of the younger generation of Venetian composers, including Grandi and Giovanni Rovetta (the eventual successor to Monteverdi at San Marco). Schütz's \"Symphonia sacra\" \"Es steh Gott auf\" (published in 1647) contains specific quotations from Monteverdi.\n\nAfter the 1650s, Monteverdi's name quickly disappears from contemporary accounts, his music generally forgotten except for the \"Lamento\", prototype of a genre that would endure well into the 18th century.\n\nInterest in Monteverdi revived in the late 18th and early 19th centuries among music scholars in Germany and Italy, although he was still regarded as essentially a historical curiosity. Wider interest in the music itself began in 1881, when Robert Eitner published a shortened version of the \"Orfeo\" score. Around this time Kurt Vogel scored the madrigals from the original manuscripts, but more critical interest was shown in the operas, following the discovery of the \"L'incoronazione\" manuscript in 1888 and that of \"Il ritorno\" in 1904. Largely through the efforts of Vincent d'Indy, all three operas were staged in one form or other, during the first quarter of the 20th century: \"L'Orfeo\" in May 1911, \"L'incoronazione\" in February 1913 and \"Il ritorno\" in May 1925.\n\nThe Italian nationalist poet Gabriele D'Annunzio lauded Monteverdi and in his novel \"Il fuoco\" (1900) wrote of \"\"il divino Claudio\" ... what a heroic soul, purely Italian in its essence!\" His vision of Monteverdi as the true founder of Italian musical lyricism was adopted by musicians who worked with the regime of Benito Mussolini (1922–1945), including Francesco Malipiero, Luigi Dallapiccola, and Mario Labroca, who contrasted Monteverdi with the decadence of the music of Richard Strauss, Claude Debussy and Igor Stravinsky.\n\nIn the years after the Second World War the operas began to be performed in the major opera houses, and eventually were established in the general repertory. The resuscitation of Monteverdi's sacred music took longer; he did not benefit from the Catholic Church's 19th-century revival of Renaissance music in the way that Palestrina did, perhaps, as Carter suggests, because Monteverdi was viewed chiefly as a secular composer. It was not until 1932 that the 1610 \"Vespers\" were published in a modern edition, followed by Redlich's revision two years later. Modern editions of the \"Selva morales\" and \"Missa e Salmi\" volumes were published respectively in 1940 and 1942.\n\nThe revival of public interest in Monteverdi's music gathered pace in the second half of the 20th century, reaching full spate in the general early-music revival of the 1970s, during which time the emphasis turned increasingly towards \"authentic\" performance using historical instruments. The magazine \"Gramophone\" notes over 30 recordings of the \"Vespers\" between 1976 and 2011, and 27 of \"Il combattimento di Tancredo e Clorinda\" between 1971 and 2013. Monteverdi's surviving operas are today regularly performed; the website Operabase notes 555 performances of the operas in 149 productions worldwide in the seasons 2011–2016, ranking Monteverdi at 30th position for all composers, and at 8th ranking for Italian opera composers. In 1985 Manfred H. Stattkus published an index to Monteverdi's works, the Stattkus-Verzeichnis, (revised in 2006) giving each composition an \"SV\" number, to be used for cataloguing and references. \n\nMonteverdi is lauded by modern critics as \"the most significant composer in late Renaissance and early Baroque Italy\"; \"one of the principal composers in the history of Western music\"; and, routinely, as the first great opera composer. These assessments reflect a contemporary perspective, since his music was largely unknown to the composers that followed him for three centuries after his death. It is, as Redlich and others have pointed out, the composers of the late 20th and 21st century that have identified with Monteverdi and sought to make his music a basis for their own. Possibly, as Chew suggests, they are attracted by Monteverdi's reputation as \"a Modern, a breaker of rules, against the Ancients, those who deferred to ancient authority\" – although the composer was, essentially, a pragmatist, \"showing what can only be described as an opportunistic and eclectic willingness to use whatever lay to hand for the purpose\". In a letter dated 16 October 1633 Monteverdi appears to endorse the view of himself as a \"modern\": \"I would rather be moderately praised for the new style than greatly praised for the ordinary\". However, Chew, in his final summation, sees the composer historically as facing both ways, willing to use modern techniques but while at the same time protective of his status as a competent composer in the \"stile antico\". Thus, says Chew, \"his achievement was both retrospective and progressive\". Monteverdi represents the late Renaissance era while simultaneously summing up much of the early Baroque. \"And in one respect in particular, his achievement was enduring: the effective projection of human emotions in music, in a way adequate for theatre as well as for chamber music.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6230", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6230", "title": "Canadian Shield", "text": "Canadian Shield\n\nThe Canadian Shield, also called the Laurentian Plateau, or \"\" (French), is a large area of exposed Precambrian igneous and high-grade metamorphic rocks (geological shield) that forms the ancient geological core of the North American continent (the North American Craton or Laurentia). Composed of igneous rock resulting from its long volcanic history, the area is covered by a thin layer of soil. With a deep, common, joined bedrock region in eastern and central Canada, it stretches north from the Great Lakes to the Arctic Ocean, covering over half of Canada; it also extends south into the northern reaches of the United States. Human population is sparse, and industrial development is minimal, while mining is prevalent.\n\nThe Canadian Shield is a physiographic division, consisting of five smaller, physiographic provinces: the Laurentian Upland, Kazan Region, Davis, Hudson and James. The shield extends into the United States as the Adirondack Mountains (connected by the Frontenac Axis) and the Superior Upland. The Canadian Shield is U-shaped and is a subsection of the Laurentia craton signifying the area of greatest glacial impact (scraping down to bare rock) creating the thin soils. The Canadian Shield is more than 3.96 billion years old. The Canadian Shield once had jagged peaks, higher than any of today's mountains, but millions of years of erosion have changed these mountains to rolling hills.\n\nThe Canadian Shield is a collage of Archean plates and accreted juvenile arc terranes and sedimentary basins of the Proterozoic Eon that were progressively amalgamated during the interval 2.45 to 1.24 Ga, with the most substantial growth period occurring during the Trans-Hudson orogeny, between ca. 1.90 to 1.80 Ga. The Canadian Shield was the first part of North America to be permanently elevated above sea level and has remained almost wholly untouched by successive encroachments of the sea upon the continent. It is the Earth's greatest area of exposed Archean rock. The metamorphic base rocks are mostly from the Precambrian Supereon (between 4.5 billion and 540 million years ago), and have been repeatedly uplifted and eroded. Today it consists largely of an area of low relief above sea level with a few monadnocks and low mountain ranges (including the Torngat and Laurentian Mountains) probably eroded from the plateau during the Cenozoic Era. During the Pleistocene Epoch, continental ice sheets depressed the land surface (see Hudson Bay), scooped out thousands of lake basins, and carried away much of the region's soil.\n\nWhen the Greenland section is included, the Shield is approximately circular, bounded on the northeast by the northeast edge of Greenland, with Hudson Bay in the middle. It covers much of Greenland, Labrador, most of Quebec north of the St. Lawrence River, much of Ontario including northern sections of the southern peninsula between the Great Lakes, the Adirondack Mountains of New York, the northernmost part of Lower Michigan and all of Upper Michigan, northern Wisconsin, northeastern Minnesota, the central/northern portions of Manitoba away from Hudson Bay, northern Saskatchewan, a small portion of northeastern Alberta, and the mainland northern Canadian territories to the east of a line extended north from the Saskatchewan/Alberta border (Northwest Territories and Nunavut). In total, the exposed area of the Shield covers approximately . The true extent of the Shield is greater still and stretches from the Western Cordillera in the west to the Appalachians in the east and as far south as Texas, but these regions are overlaid with much younger rocks and sediment. The underlying rock structure also includes Hudson Bay.\n\nThe Canadian Shield is among the oldest on earth, with regions dating from 2.5 to 4.2 billion years. \nThe multitude of rivers and lakes in the entire region is caused by the watersheds of the area being so young and in a state of sorting themselves out with the added effect of post-glacial rebound. The Shield was originally an area of very large, very tall mountains (about ) with much volcanic activity, but over hundreds of millions of years, the area has been eroded to its current topographic appearance of relatively low relief. It has some of the oldest (extinct) volcanoes on the planet. It has over 150 volcanic belts (now deformed and eroded down to nearly flat plains) whose bedrock ranges from 600 to 1200 million years old.\n\nEach belt probably grew by the coalescence of accumulations erupted from numerous vents, making the tally of volcanoes reach the hundreds. Many of Canada's major ore deposits are associated with Precambrian volcanoes.\n\nThe Sturgeon Lake Caldera in Kenora District, Ontario, is one of the world's best preserved mineralized Neoarchean caldera complexes, which is 2.7 billion years old. The Canadian Shield also contains the Mackenzie dike swarm, which is the largest dike swarm known on Earth.\n\nMountains have deep roots and float on the denser mantle much like an iceberg at sea. As mountains erode, their roots rise and are eroded in turn. The rocks that now form the surface of the Shield were once far below the Earth's surface.\n\nThe high pressures and temperatures at those depths provided ideal conditions for mineralization. Although these mountains are now heavily eroded, many large mountains still exist in Canada's far north called the Arctic Cordillera. This is a vast deeply dissected mountain range, stretching from northernmost Ellesmere Island to the northernmost tip of Labrador. The range's highest peak is Nunavut's Barbeau Peak at above sea level. Precambrian rock is the major component of the bedrock.\n\nThe North American craton is the bedrock forming the heart of the North American continent and the Canadian Shield is the largest exposed part of the craton's bedrock.\n\nThe Canadian Shield is part of an ancient continent called Arctica, which was formed about 2.5 billion years ago during the Neoarchean era. It was split into Greenland, Laurentia, Scotland and Siberia and is now roughly situated in the Arctic around the current North Pole.\n\nThe current surface expression of the Shield is one of very thin soil lying on top of the bedrock, with many bare outcrops. This arrangement was caused by severe glaciation during the ice age, which covered the Shield and scraped the rock clean.\n\nThe lowlands of the Canadian Shield have a very dense soil that is not suitable for forestation; it also contains many marshes and bogs (muskegs). The rest of the region has coarse soil that does not retain moisture well and is frozen with permafrost throughout the year. Forests are not as dense in the north.\n\nThe Shield is covered in parts by vast boreal forests in the south that support natural ecosystems as well as a major logging industry. This boreal forest area includes ecoregions such as the Eastern Canadian Shield taiga that covers northern Quebec and most of Labrador, and the Midwestern Canadian Shield forests that run westwards from Northwestern Ontario. Hydrographical drainage is generally poor, the soil compacting effects of glaciation being one of the many causes. Tundra typically prevails in the northern regions. Many mammals such as caribou, white-tailed deer, moose, wolves, wolverines, weasels, mink, otters, grizzly bear, polar bears and black bears are present. In the case of polar bears (\"Ursus maritimus\") the Shield area contains many of the denning locations such as the Wapusk National Park.\n\nThe Canadian Shield is one of the world's richest areas in terms of mineral ores. It is filled with substantial deposits of nickel, gold, silver, and copper. Throughout the Shield there are many mining towns extracting these minerals. The largest, and one of the best known, is Sudbury, Ontario. Sudbury is an exception to the normal process of forming minerals in the Shield since the Sudbury Basin is an ancient meteorite impact crater. Ejecta from the meteorite impact was found in the Rove Formation in May 2007. The nearby, but less known Temagami Magnetic Anomaly, has striking similarities to the Sudbury Basin. This suggests it could be a second metal-rich impact crater.\n\nIn northeastern Quebec, the giant Manicouagan Reservoir is the site of an extensive hydroelectric project (Manic-cinq, or Manic-5). This is one of the largest-known meteorite impact craters on Earth.\n\nThe Flin Flon greenstone belt in central Manitoba and east-central Saskatchewan is one of the largest Paleoproterozoic volcanic-hosted massive sulfide (VMS) districts in the world, containing 27 copper-zinc-(gold) deposits from which more than 183 million tons of sulfide have been mined.\n\nThe Shield, particularly the portion in the Northwest Territories, has recently been the site of several major diamond discoveries. The kimberlite pipes in which the diamonds are found are closely associated with cratons, which provide the deep lithospheric mantle required to stabilize diamond as a mineral. The kimberlite eruptions then bring the diamonds from over depth to the surface. Currently the Ekati and Diavik mines are actively mining kimberlite diamonds.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6231", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6231", "title": "Comic book", "text": "Comic book\n\nA comic book or comicbook, also called comic magazine or simply comic, is a publication that consists of comic art in the form of sequential juxtaposed panels that represent individual scenes. Panels are often accompanied by brief descriptive prose and written narrative, usually dialog contained in word balloons emblematic of the comics art form. Although some origins in 18th century Japan and 1830s Europe, comic books were first popularized in the United States during the 1930s. The first modern comic book, \"Famous Funnies\", was released in the United States in 1933 and was a reprinting of earlier newspaper humor comic strips, which had established many of the story-telling devices used in comics. The term \"comic book\" derives from American comic books once being a compilation of comic strips of a humorous tone; however, this practice was replaced by featuring stories of all genres, usually not humorous in tone.\n\nComic books are reliant on their organization and appearance. Authors largely focus on the frame of the page, size, orientation, and panel positions. These characteristic aspects of comic books are necessary in conveying the content and messages of the author. The key elements of comic books include panels, balloons (speech bubbles), text (lines), and characters. Balloons are usually convex spatial containers of information that are related to a character using a tail element. The tail has an origin, path, tip, and pointed direction. Key tasks in the creation of comic books are writing, drawing, and coloring.\n\nComics as a print medium have existed in America since the printing of \"The Adventures of Mr. Obadiah Oldbuck\" in 1842 in hardcover, making it the first known American prototype comic book. Proto-comics periodicals began appearing early in the 20th century, with historians generally citing Dell Publishing's 36-page \"Famous Funnies: A Carnival of Comics\" as the first true American comic book; Goulart, for example, calls it \"the cornerstone for one of the most lucrative branches of magazine publishing\". The introduction of Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster's Superman in 1938 turned comic books into a major industry, and ushered the Golden Age of Comics. The Golden Age originated the archetype of the superhero.\n\nHistorians generally divide the timeline of the American comic book into eras. The Golden Age of Comic Books began with the introduction of Superman in 1938, spurring a period of high sales. The Silver Age of comic books is generally considered to date from the first successful revival of the then-dormant superhero form, with the debut of the Flash in \"Showcase\" #4 (Oct. 1956). The Silver Age lasted through the late 1960s or early 1970s, during which time Marvel Comics revolutionized the medium with such naturalistic superheroes as Stan Lee and Jack Kirby's Fantastic Four and Lee and Steve Ditko's Spider-Man. The demarcation between the Silver Age and the following era, the Bronze Age of Comic Books, is less well-defined, with the Bronze Age running from the very early 1970s through the mid-1980s. The Modern Age of Comic Books runs from the mid-1980s to the present day.\n\nA notable event in the history of the American comic book came with psychiatrist Fredric Wertham's criticisms of the medium in his book \"Seduction of the Innocent\" (1954), which prompted the American Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency to investigate comic books. In response to attention from the government and from the media, the U.S. comic book industry set up the Comics Magazine Association of America. The CMAA instilled the Comics Code Authority in 1954 and drafted the self-censorship Comics Code that year, which required all comic books to go through a process of approval. It was not until the 1970s that comic books could be published without passing through the inspection of the CMAA. The Code was made formally defunct in 2011.\n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, a surge of creativity emerged in what became known as underground comix. Published and distributed independently of the established comics industry, most of such comics reflected the youth counterculture and drug culture of the time. Many had an uninhibited, often irreverent style; their frank depictions of nudity, sex, profanity, and politics had no parallel outside their precursors, the pornographic and even more obscure \"Tijuana bibles\". Underground comics were almost never sold at newsstands, but rather in such youth-oriented outlets as head shops and record stores, as well as by mail order.\n\nFrank Stack's \"The Adventures of Jesus\", published under the name Foolbert Sturgeon, has been credited as the first underground comic; while R. Crumb and the crew of cartoonists who worked on \"Zap Comix\" popularized the form.\n\nThe rise of comic book specialty stores in the late 1970s created/paralleled a dedicated market for \"independent\" or \"alternative comics\" in the U.S. The first such comics included the anthology series \"Star Reach\", published by comic-book writer Mike Friedrich from 1974 to 1979, and Harvey Pekar's \"American Splendor\", which continued sporadic publication into the 21st century and which Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini adapted into a 2003 film. Some independent comics continued in the tradition of underground comics. While their content generally remained less explicit, others resembled the output of mainstream publishers in format and genre, but were published by smaller artist-owned companies or by single artists. A few (notably \"RAW\") represented experimental attempts to bring comics closer to the status of fine art.\n\nDuring the 1970s the \"small press\" culture grew and diversified. By the 1980s, several independent publishers - such as Pacific, Eclipse, First, Comico, and Fantagraphics - had started releasing a wide range of styles and formats—from color-superhero, detective, and science-fiction comic books to black-and-white magazine-format stories of Latin American magical realism.\n\nA number of small publishers in the 1990s changed the format and distribution of their comics to more closely resemble non-comics publishing. The \"minicomics\" form, an extremely informal version of self-publishing, arose in the 1980s and became increasingly popular among artists in the 1990s, despite reaching an even more limited audience than the small press.\n\nSmall publishers regularly releasing titles include Avatar Comics, Hyperwerks, Raytoons, and Terminal Press, buoyed by such advances in printing technology as digital print-on-demand.\n\nIn 1964, Richard Kyle coined the term \"graphic novel\".. Precursors of the form existed by the 1920s, which saw a revival of the medieval woodcut tradition by Belgian Frans Masereel, American Lynd Ward and others, including Stan Lee.\nIn 1950, St. John Publications produced the digest-sized, adult-oriented \"picture novel\" \"It Rhymes with Lust\", a 128-page digest by pseudonymous writer \"Drake Waller\" (Arnold Drake and Leslie Waller), penciler Matt Baker and inker Ray Osrin, touted as \"an original full-length novel\" on its cover. In 1971, writer-artist Gil Kane and collaborators devised the paperback \"comics novel\" \"Blackmark\". Will Eisner popularized the term \"graphic novel\" when he used it on the cover of the paperback edition of his work \"A Contract with God, and Other Tenement Stories\" in 1978.\n\nThe 1970s saw the advent of specialty comic book stores. Initially, comic books were marketed by publishers to children because comic books were perceived as children's entertainment. However, with increasing recognition of comics as an art form and the growing pop culture presence of comic book conventions, they are now embraced by many adults.\n\nComic book collectors are often lifelong enthusiasts of the comic book stories and they usually focus on particular heroes and attempt to assemble the entire run of a title. Comics are published with a sequential number. The first issue of a long-running comic book series is commonly the rarest and most desirable to collectors. The first appearance of a specific character, however, might be in a pre-existing title. For example, Spider-Man's first appearance was in \"Amazing Fantasy\" #15. New characters were often introduced this way, and did not receive their own titles until there was a proven audience for the hero. As a result, comics that feature the first appearance of an important character will sometimes be even harder to find than the number 1 issue of a character's own title.\n\nSome rare comic books include copies of the unreleased \"Motion Picture Funnies Weekly\" #1 from 1939. Eight copies, plus one without a cover, emerged in the estate of the deceased publisher in 1974. The \"Pay Copy\" of this book sold for $43,125 in a 2005 Heritage auction.\n\nThe most valuable American comics have combined rarity and quality with the first appearances of popular and enduring characters. Four comic books have sold for over $1 million USD as of December 2010, including two examples of Action Comics #1, the first appearance of Superman, both sold privately through online dealer ComicConnect.com in 2010, and Detective Comics #27, the first appearance of Batman, via public auction.\n\nUpdating the above price obtained for \"Action Comics\" #1, the first appearance of Superman, the highest sale on record for this book is $3.2 million, for a 9.0 copy. \n\nMisprints, promotional comic-dealer incentive printings, and issues with extremely low distribution also generally have scarcity value. The rarest modern comic books include the original press run of \"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\" #5, which DC executive Paul Levitz recalled and pulped due to the appearance of a vintage Victorian era advertisement for \"Marvel Douche\", which the publisher considered offensive; only 100 copies exist, most of which have been CGC graded. (See Recalled comics for more pulped, recalled, and erroneous comics.)\n\nIn 2000, a company named Comics Guaranty (CGC) began to \"slab\" comics, encasing them in a thick plastic and giving them a numeric grade. As of 2014, there are two companies that provide third party grading of comic book condition. Because condition is so important to the value of rare comics, the idea of grading by a company that does not buy or sell comics seems like a good one. However, there is some controversy about whether this grading service is worth the high cost, and whether it is a positive development for collectors, or if it primarily services speculators who wish to make a quick profit trading in comics as one might trade in stocks or fine art. Comic grading has created valuation standards that online price guides such as GoCollect and GPAnalysis have used to report on real-time market values.\n\nThe original artwork pages from comic books are also collected, and these are perhaps the rarest of all comic book collector's items, as there is only one unique page of artwork for each page that was printed and published. These were created by a writer, who created the story; a pencil artist, who laid out the sequential panels on the page; an ink artist, who went over the pencil with pen and black ink; a letterer, who provided the dialogue and narration of the story by hand lettering each word; and finally a colorist, who added color as the last step before the finished pages went to the printer.\n\nWhen the original pages of artwork are returned by the printer, they are typically given back to the artists, who sometimes sell them at comic book conventions, or in galleries and art shows related to comic book art. The original pages of the first appearances of such legendary characters as Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman and Spider-man are considered priceless.\n\n \nFrance and Belgium have a long tradition in comics and comic books, called \"BDs\" (an abbreviation of \"bande dessinées\") in French and \"strips\" in Dutch. Belgian comic books originally written in Dutch show the influence of the Francophone \"Franco-Belgian\" comics, but have their own distinct style.\n\nThe name \"bande dessinée\" derives from the original description of the art form as drawn strips (the phrase literally translates as \"the drawn strip\"), analogous to the sequence of images in a film strip. As in its English equivalent, the word \"bande\" can be applied to both film and comics. Significantly, the French-language term contains no indication of subject-matter, unlike the American terms \"comics\" and \"funnies\", which imply an art form not to be taken seriously. The distinction of comics as \"le neuvième art\" (literally, \"the ninth art\") is prevalent in French scholarship on the form, as is the concept of comics criticism and scholarship itself. Relative to the respective size of their populations, the innumerable authors in France and Belgium publish a high volume of comic books. In North America, the more serious Franco-Belgian comics are often seen as equivalent to graphic novels, but whether they are long or short, bound or in magazine format, in Europe there is no need for a more sophisticated term, as the art's name does not itself imply something frivolous.\n\nIn France, authors control the publication of most comics. The author works within a self-appointed time-frame, and it is common for readers to wait six months or as long as two years between installments. Most books first appear in print as a hardcover book, typically with 48, 56, or 64 pages.\n\nAlthough \"Ally Sloper's Half Holiday\" (1884), the first comic published in Britain, aimed at an adult market, publishers quickly targeted a younger demographic, which has led to most publications being for children and has created an association in the public's mind of comics as somewhat juvenile. British comics in the early 20th century typically evolved from illustrated penny dreadfuls of the Victorian era (featuring Sweeney Todd, Dick Turpin and \"Varney the Vampire\"). \n\nThe two most popular British comic books, \"The Beano\" and \"The Dandy\", were released by DC Thomson in the 1930s. By 1950 the weekly circulation of both reached two million. Explaining the enormous popularity of comics in British popular culture during this period, Anita O’Brien, director curator at London’s Cartoon Museum, states: “When comics like the Beano and Dandy were invented back in the 1930s - and through really to the 1950s and 60s - these comics were almost the only entertainment available to children.\"\n\nIn 1954, \"Tiger\" comics introduced \"Roy of the Rovers\", the hugely popular football based strip recounting the life of Roy Race and the team he played for, Melchester Rovers. The stock media phrase \"real 'Roy of the Rovers' stuff\" is often used by football writers, commentators and fans when describing displays of great skill, or surprising results that go against the odds, in reference to the dramatic storylines that were the strip's trademark. Other comic books such as \"Eagle\", \"Valiant\", \"Warrior\", \"Viz\" and \"2000 AD\" also flourished. Some comics, such as \"Judge Dredd\" and other \"2000 AD\" titles, have been published in a tabloid form. Underground comics and \"small press\" titles have also appeared in the UK, notably \"Oz\" and \"Escape Magazine\".\n\nThe content of \"Action\", another title aimed at children and launched in the mid-1970s, became the subject of discussion in the House of Commons. Although on a smaller scale than similar investigations in the U.S., such concerns led to a moderation of content published within British comics. Such moderation never became formalized to the extent of promulgating a code, nor did it last long. The UK has also established a healthy market in the reprinting and repackaging of material, notably material originating in the U.S. The lack of reliable supplies of American comic books led to a variety of black-and-white reprints, including Marvel's monster comics of the 1950s, Fawcett's Captain Marvel, and other characters such as Sheena, Mandrake the Magician, and the Phantom. Several reprint companies became involved in repackaging American material for the British market, notably the importer and distributor Thorpe & Porter. Marvel Comics established a UK office in 1972. DC Comics and Dark Horse Comics also opened offices in the 1990s. The repackaging of European material has occurred less frequently, although \"The Adventures of Tintin\" and \"Asterix\" serials have been successfully translated and repackaged in softcover books.\n\nIn the 1980s, a resurgence of British writers and artists gained prominence in mainstream comic books, which was dubbed the \"British Invasion\" in comic book history. These writers and artists brought with them their own mature themes and philosophy such as anarchy, controversy and politics common in British media. These elements would pave the way for mature and \"darker and edgier\" comic books and jump start the Modern Age of Comics. Writers included Alan Moore, famous for his \"V for Vendetta\", \"From Hell\", \"Watchmen\", \"Marvelman\", and \"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\"; Neil Gaiman with \"The Sandman\" mythos and \"Books of Magic\"; Warren Ellis, creator of \"Transmetropolitan\" and \"Planetary\"; and others such as Mark Millar, creator of \"Wanted\" and \"Kick-Ass\". The comic book series \"Hellblazer\", which is largely set in Britain and starring the magician John Constantine, paved the way for British writers such as Jamie Delano.\n\nAt Christmas time, publishers repackage and commission material for comic annuals, printed and bound as hardcover A4-size books; \"Rupert\" supplies a famous example of the British comic annual. DC Thomson also repackages \"The Broons\" and \"Oor Wullie\" strips in softcover A4-size books for the holiday season.\n\nOn 19 March 2012, the British postal service, the Royal Mail, released a set of stamps depicting British comic-book characters and series. The collection featured \"The Beano\", \"The Dandy\", \"Eagle\", \"The Topper\", \"Roy of the Rovers\", \"Bunty\", \"Buster\", \"Valiant\", \"Twinkle\" and \"2000 AD\".\n\nIn Italy, comics (known in Italian as \"fumetti\") made their debut as humor strips at the end of the 19th century, and later evolved into adventure stories. After World War II, however, artists like Hugo Pratt and Guido Crepax exposed Italian comics to an international audience. Popular comic books such as \"Diabolik\" or the \"Bonelli\" line—namely \"Tex Willer\" or \"Dylan Dog\"—remain best-sellers.\n\nMainstream comics are usually published on a monthly basis, in a black-and-white digest size format, with approximately 100 to 132 pages. Collections of classic material for the most famous characters, usually with more than 200 pages, are also common. Author comics are published in the French BD format, with an example being Pratt's \"Corto Maltese\".\n\nItalian cartoonists show the influence of comics from other countries, including France, Belgium, Spain, and Argentina. Italy is also famous for being one of the foremost producers of Walt Disney comic stories outside the U.S. Donald Duck's superhero alter ego, Paperinik, known in English as Superduck, was created in Italy.\n\n\"Čtyřlístek\" (in English translated as Lucky Four or Four-Leaf Clover) is one of the most well-known comics for children published in the Czech Republic.\n\nThe first comic books in Japan appeared during the 18th century in the form of woodblock-printed booklets containing short stories drawn from folk tales, legends, and historical accounts, told in a simple visual-verbal idiom. Known as , , and , these were written primarily for less literate readers. However, with the publication in 1775 of Koikawa Harumachi's comic book , an evolved form of comic book originated, which required greater literacy and cultural sophistication. This was known as the . Published in thousands of copies, the \"kibyōshi\" may have been the earliest fully realized comic book for adults in world literary history. Approximately 2,000 titles remain extant.\n\nModern comic books in Japan developed from a mixture of these earlier comic books and of woodblock prints with Western styles of drawing. They took their current form shortly after World War II. They are usually published in black-and-white, except for the covers, which are usually printed in four colors, although occasionally, the first few pages may also be printed in full color. The term \"manga\" means \"random (or whimsical) pictures\", and first came into common usage in the late 18th century with the publication of such works as Santō Kyōden's picturebook (1798) and Aikawa Minwa's \"Comic Sketches of a Hundred Women\" (1798). During the Meiji period, the term \"Akahon\" was also common.\n\nWestern artists were brought over to teach their students such concepts as line, form, and color; things which had not been regarded as conceptually important in \"ukiyo-e\", as the idea behind the picture was of paramount importance. Manga at this time was referred to as \"Ponchi-e\" (Punch-picture) and, like its British counterpart \"Punch\" magazine, mainly depicted humor and political satire in short one- or four-picture format.\n\nDr. Osamu Tezuka (1928–1989) further developed this form. Seeing an animated war propaganda film titled inspired Tezuka to become a comic artist. He introduced episodic storytelling and character development in comic format, in which each story is part of larger story arc. The only text in Tezuka's comics was the characters' dialogue and this further lent his comics a cinematic quality. Inspired by the work of Walt Disney, Tezuka also adopted a style of drawing facial features in which a character's eyes, nose, and mouth are drawn in an extremely exaggerated manner. This style created immediately recognizable expressions using very few lines, and the simplicity of this style allowed Tezuka to be prolific. Tezuka's work generated new interest in the \"ukiyo-e\" tradition, in which the image is a representation of an idea, rather than a depiction of reality.\n\nThough a close equivalent to the American comic book, manga has historically held a more important place in Japanese culture than comics have in American culture. Japanese society shows a wide respect for manga, both as an art form and as a form of popular literature. Many manga become television shows or short films. As with its American counterpart, some manga has been criticized for its sexuality and violence, although in the absence of official or even industry restrictions on content, artists have freely created manga for every age group and for every topic.\n\nManga magazines—also known as \"anthologies\"—often run several series concurrently, with approximately 20 to 40 pages allocated to each series per issue. These magazines range from 200 to more than 850 pages each. Manga magazines also contain one-shot comics and a variety of four-panel yonkoma (equivalent to comic strips). Manga series may continue for many years if they are successful, with stories often collected and reprinted in book-sized volumes called , the equivalent of the American trade paperbacks. These volumes use higher-quality paper and are useful to readers who want to be brought up to date with a series, or to readers who find the cost of the weekly or monthly publications to be prohibitive. Deluxe versions are printed as commemorative or collectible editions.\n\n, fan-made Japanese comics operate in a far larger market in Japan than the American \"underground comics\" market; the largest dōjinshi fair, Comiket, attracts 500,000 visitors twice a year.\n\nDistribution has historically been a problem for the comic book industry with many mainstream retailers declining to carry extensive stocks of the most interesting and popular comics. The smartphone and the tablet have turned out to be an ideal medium for online distribution.\n\nOn November 13, 2007, Marvel Comics launched Marvel Digital Comics Unlimited, a subscription service allowing readers to read many comics from Marvel's history online. The service also includes periodic release new comics not available elsewhere. With the release of \"Avenging Spider-Man\" Marvel also became the first publisher to provide free digital copies as part of the print copy of the comic book.\n\nWith the growing popularity of smartphones and tablets, many major publishers have begun releasing titles in digital form. The most popular platform is comiXology. Some platforms, such as Graphicly, have shut down,\n\nMany libraries have extensive collections of comics in the form of graphic novels. This is a convenient way for many in the public to become familiar with the medium.\n\nThe largest comic book ever published was on the 30th of August 2014 in Fremont, California, USA. It was chapter one of the graphic novel CruZader™: Agent of the Vatican by Omar Morales and it measured at 60.96 cm by 94.46 cm (2 ft by 3 ft 1.19 in).\n\nThe Japanese manga author Eiichiro Oda has made comic book history by attaining a Guinness World Record title for having the \"Most copies published for the same comic book series by a single author\". His widely popular comic titled One Piece was first serialised in Weekly Shonen Jump magazine (Shueisha) in Japan, back in December 1997. In the space of less than two decades, the series has accumulated an incredibly loyal following and has gone on to sell an incredible 320,866,000 units, with a substantial 77 volumes of the comic book released over that period.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6233", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6233", "title": "Connected space", "text": "Connected space\n\nIn topology and related branches of mathematics, a connected space is a topological space that cannot be represented as the union of two or more disjoint nonempty open subsets. Connectedness is one of the principal topological properties that are used to distinguish topological spaces.\n\nA subset of a topological space \"X\" is a connected set if it is a connected space when viewed as a subspace of \"X\".\n\nA topological space \"X\" is said to be disconnected if it is the union of two disjoint nonempty open sets. Otherwise, \"X\" is said to be connected. A subset of a topological space is said to be connected if it is connected under its subspace topology. Some authors exclude the empty set (with its unique topology) as a connected space, but this article does not follow that practice.\n\nFor a topological space \"X\" the following conditions are equivalent:\n\n\nThe maximal connected subsets (ordered by inclusion) of a nonempty topological space are called the connected components of the space.\nThe components of any topological space \"X\" form a partition of \"X\": they are disjoint, nonempty, and their union is the whole space.\nEvery component is a closed subset of the original space. It follows that, in the case where their number is finite, each component is also an open subset. However, if their number is infinite, this might not be the case; for instance, the connected components of the set of the rational numbers are the one-point sets (singletons), which are not open.\n\nLet formula_1 be the connected component of \"x\" in a topological space \"X\", and formula_2 be the intersection of all clopen sets containing \"x\" (called quasi-component of \"x\".) Then formula_3 where the equality holds if \"X\" is compact Hausdorff or locally connected.\n\nA space in which all components are one-point sets is called totally disconnected. Related to this property, a space \"X\" is called totally separated if, for any two distinct elements \"x\" and \"y\" of \"X\", there exist disjoint open sets \"U\" containing \"x\" and \"V\" containing \"y\" such that \"X\" is the union of \"U\" and \"V\". Clearly any totally separated space is totally disconnected, but the converse does not hold. For example take two copies of the rational numbers Q, and identify them at every point except zero. The resulting space, with the quotient topology, is totally disconnected. However, by considering the two copies of zero, one sees that the space is not totally separated. In fact, it is not even Hausdorff, and the condition of being totally separated is strictly stronger than the condition of being Hausdorff.\n\n\nAn example of a space that is not connected is a plane with an infinite line deleted from it. Other examples of disconnected spaces (that is, spaces which are not connected) include the plane with an annulus removed, as well as the union of two disjoint closed disks, where all examples of this paragraph bear the subspace topology induced by two-dimensional Euclidean space.\n\nA path-connected space is a stronger notion of connectedness, requiring the structure of a path. A path from a point \"x\" to a point \"y\" in a topological space \"X\" is a continuous function \"f\" from the unit interval [0,1] to \"X\" with \"f\"(0) = \"x\" and \"f\"(1) = \"y\". A path-component of \"X\" is an equivalence class of \"X\" under the equivalence relation which makes \"x\" equivalent to \"y\" if there is a path from \"x\" to \"y\". The space \"X\" is said to be path-connected (or pathwise connected or 0-connected) if there is exactly one path-component, i.e. if there is a path joining any two points in \"X\". Again, many authors exclude the empty space.\n\nEvery path-connected space is connected. The converse is not always true: examples of connected spaces that are not path-connected include the extended long line \"L\"* and the \"topologist's sine curve\".\n\nSubsets of the real line R are connected if and only if they are path-connected; these subsets are the intervals of R.\nAlso, open subsets of R or C are connected if and only if they are path-connected.\nAdditionally, connectedness and path-connectedness are the same for finite topological spaces.\n\nA space \"X\" is said to be arc-connected or arcwise connected if any two distinct points can be joined by an \"arc\", that is a path \"f\" which is a homeomorphism between the unit interval [0, 1] and its image \"f\"([0, 1]). It can be shown any Hausdorff space which is path-connected is also arc-connected. An example of a space which is path-connected but not arc-connected is provided by adding a second copy 0' of 0 to the nonnegative real numbers <nowiki>[</nowiki>0, ∞<nowiki>)</nowiki>. One endows this set with a partial order by specifying that 0'<\"a\" for any positive number \"a\", but leaving 0 and 0' incomparable. One then endows this set with the \"order topology\", that is one takes the open intervals\n(\"a\", \"b\") = {\"x\" | \"a\" < \"x\" < \"b\"} and the half-open intervals <nowiki>[</nowiki>0, \"a\"<nowiki>)</nowiki> = {\"x\" | 0 ≤ x < \"a\"}, <nowiki>[</nowiki>0', \"a\"<nowiki>)</nowiki> = {\"x\" | 0' ≤ \"x\" < \"a\"} as a base for the topology. The resulting space is a T space but not a Hausdorff space. Clearly 0 and 0' can be connected by a path but not by an arc in this space.\n\nA topological space is said to be locally connected at a point \"x\" if every neighbourhood of \"x\" contains a connected open neighbourhood. It is locally connected if it has a base of connected sets. It can be shown that a space \"X\" is locally connected if and only if every component of every open set of \"X\" is open. The topologist's sine curve is an example of a connected space that is not locally connected.\n\nSimilarly, a topological space is said to be if it has a base of path-connected sets.\nAn open subset of a locally path-connected space is connected if and only if it is path-connected.\nThis generalizes the earlier statement about R and C, each of which is locally path-connected. More generally, any topological manifold is locally path-connected.\n\nNeither local connectedness nor local path connectedness necessarily implies connectedness or path connectedness. For example, the space formula_7 is locally connected and locally path connected but neither connected nor path connected.\n\nThe intersection of connected sets is not necessarily connected.\n\nThe union of connected sets is not necessarily connected. Consider a collection formula_8 of connected sets whose union is formula_9. If formula_10 is disconnected and formula_11 is a separation of formula_10 (with formula_13 disjoint and open in formula_10), then each formula_15 must be entirely contained in either formula_16 or formula_17, since otherwise, formula_18 and formula_19 (which are disjoint and open in formula_15) would be a separation of formula_15, contradicting the assumption that it is connected.\n\nThis means that, if the union formula_10 is disconnected, then the collection formula_8 can be partitioned to two sub-collections, such that the unions of the sub-collections are disjoint and open in formula_10 (see picture). This implies that in several cases, a union of connected sets \"is\" necessarily connected. In particular:\n\n\nThe set difference of connected sets is not necessarily connected. However, if \"X\"⊇\"Y\" and their difference \"X\"\\\"Y\" is disconnected (and thus can be written as a union of two open sets \"X1\" and \"X2\"), then the union of \"Y\" with each such component is connected (i.e. \"Y\"∪\"Xi\" is connected for all \"i\"). Proof: By contradiction, suppose \"Y\"∪\"X1\" is not connected. So it can be written as the union of two disjoint open sets, e.g. \"Y\"∪\"X1\" = \"Z1\"∪\"Z2\". Because \"Y\" is connected, it must be entirely contained in one of these components, say \"Z1\", and thus \"Z2\" is contained in \"X1\". Now we know that:\nThe two sets in the last union are disjoint and open in \"X\", so there is a separation of \"X\", contradicting the fact that \"X\" is connected.\n\n\nGraphs have path connected subsets, namely those subsets for which every pair of points has a path of edges joining them.\nBut it is not always possible to find a topology on the set of points which induces the same connected sets. The 5-cycle graph (and any \"n\"-cycle with \"n\">3 odd) is one such example.\n\nAs a consequence, a notion of connectedness can be formulated independently of the topology on a space. To wit, there is a category of connective spaces consisting of sets with collections of connected subsets satisfying connectivity axioms; their morphisms are those functions which map connected sets to connected sets . Topological spaces and graphs are special cases of connective spaces; indeed, the finite connective spaces are precisely the finite graphs.\n\nHowever, every graph can be canonically made into a topological space, by treating vertices as points and edges as copies of the unit interval (see topological graph theory#Graphs as topological spaces). Then one can show that the graph is connected (in the graph theoretical sense) if and only if it is connected as a topological space.\n\nThere are stronger forms of connectedness for topological spaces, for instance: \n\nIn general, note that any path connected space must be connected but there exist connected spaces that are not path connected. The deleted comb space furnishes such an example, as does the above-mentioned topologist's sine curve.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6235", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6235", "title": "Cell nucleus", "text": "Cell nucleus\n\nIn cell biology, the nucleus (pl. \"nuclei\"; from Latin or , meaning \"kernel\" or \"seed\") is a membrane-enclosed organelle found in eukaryotic cells. Eukaryotes usually have a single nucleus, but a few cell types, such as mammalian red blood cells, have no nuclei, and a few others have many. Human skeletal muscle cells have more than one nucleus, as do eukaryotes like fungi.\n\nCell nuclei contain most of the cell's genetic material, organized as multiple long linear DNA molecules in complex with a large variety of proteins, such as histones, to form chromosomes. The genes within these chromosomes are the cell's nuclear genome and are structured in such a way to promote cell function. The nucleus maintains the integrity of genes and controls the activities of the cell by regulating gene expression—the nucleus is, therefore, the control center of the cell. The main structures making up the nucleus are the nuclear envelope, a double membrane that encloses the entire organelle and isolates its contents from the cellular cytoplasm, and the nuclear matrix (which includes the nuclear lamina), a network within the nucleus that adds mechanical support, much like the cytoskeleton, which supports the cell as a whole.\n\nBecause the nuclear membrane is impermeable to large molecules, nuclear pores are required to regulate nuclear transport of molecules across the envelope. The pores cross both nuclear membranes, providing a channel through which larger molecules must be actively transported by carrier proteins while allowing free movement of small molecules and ions. Movement of large molecules such as proteins and RNA through the pores is required for both gene expression and the maintenance of chromosomes. Although the interior of the nucleus does not contain any membrane-bound sub compartments, its contents are not uniform, and a number of \"sub-nuclear bodies\" exist, made up of unique proteins, RNA molecules, and particular parts of the chromosomes. The best-known of these is the nucleolus, which is mainly involved in the assembly of ribosomes. After being produced in the nucleolus, ribosomes are exported to the cytoplasm where they translate mRNA.\n\nThe nucleus was the first organelle to be discovered. What is most likely the oldest preserved drawing dates back to the early microscopist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek (1632–1723). He observed a \"lumen\", the nucleus, in the red blood cells of salmon. Unlike mammalian red blood cells, those of other vertebrates still contain nuclei.\n\nThe nucleus was also described by Franz Bauer in 1804 and in more detail in 1831 by Scottish botanist Robert Brown in a talk at the Linnean Society of London. Brown was studying orchids under microscope when he observed an opaque area, which he called the \"areola\" or \"nucleus\", in the cells of the flower's outer layer.\n\nHe did not suggest a potential function. In 1838, Matthias Schleiden proposed that the nucleus plays a role in generating cells, thus he introduced the name \"cytoblast\" (cell builder). He believed that he had observed new cells assembling around \"cytoblasts\". Franz Meyen was a strong opponent of this view, having already described cells multiplying by division and believing that many cells would have no nuclei. The idea that cells can be generated de novo, by the \"cytoblast\" or otherwise, contradicted work by Robert Remak (1852) and Rudolf Virchow (1855) who decisively propagated the new paradigm that cells are generated solely by cells (\"Omnis cellula e cellula\"). The function of the nucleus remained unclear.\n\nBetween 1877 and 1878, Oscar Hertwig published several studies on the fertilization of sea urchin eggs, showing that the nucleus of the sperm enters the oocyte and fuses with its nucleus. This was the first time it was suggested that an individual develops from a (single) nucleated cell. This was in contradiction to Ernst Haeckel's theory that the complete phylogeny of a species would be repeated during embryonic development, including generation of the first nucleated cell from a \"monerula\", a structureless mass of primordial mucus (\"Urschleim\"). Therefore, the necessity of the sperm nucleus for fertilization was discussed for quite some time. However, Hertwig confirmed his observation in other animal groups, including amphibians and molluscs. Eduard Strasburger produced the same results for plants in 1884. This paved the way to assign the nucleus an important role in heredity. In 1873, August Weismann postulated the equivalence of the maternal and paternal germ \"cells\" for heredity. The function of the nucleus as carrier of genetic information became clear only later, after mitosis was discovered and the Mendelian rules were rediscovered at the beginning of the 20th century; the chromosome theory of heredity was therefore developed.\n\nThe nucleus is the largest cellular organelle in animal cells.\nIn mammalian cells, the average diameter of the nucleus is approximately 6 micrometres (µm), which occupies about 10% of the total cell volume. The viscous liquid within it is called nucleoplasm (or karyolymph), and is similar in composition to the cytosol found outside the nucleus. It appears as a dense, roughly spherical or irregular organelle. The composition by dry weight of the nucleus is approximately: DNA 9%, RNA 1%, Histone Protein 11%, Residual Protein 14%, Acidic Proteins 65%.\n\nThe nuclear envelope, otherwise known as nuclear membrane, consists of two cellular membranes, an inner and an outer membrane, arranged parallel to one another and separated by 10 to 50 nanometres (nm). The nuclear envelope completely encloses the nucleus and separates the cell's genetic material from the surrounding cytoplasm, serving as a barrier to prevent macromolecules from diffusing freely between the nucleoplasm and the cytoplasm. The outer nuclear membrane is continuous with the membrane of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), and is similarly studded with ribosomes. The space between the membranes is called the perinuclear space and is continuous with the RER lumen.\n\nNuclear pores, which provide aqueous channels through the envelope, are composed of multiple proteins, collectively referred to as nucleoporins. The pores are about 125 million daltons in molecular weight and consist of around 50 (in yeast) to several hundred proteins (in vertebrates). The pores are 100 nm in total diameter; however, the gap through which molecules freely diffuse is only about 9 nm wide, due to the presence of regulatory systems within the center of the pore. This size selectively allows the passage of small water-soluble molecules while preventing larger molecules, such as nucleic acids and larger proteins, from inappropriately entering or exiting the nucleus. These large molecules must be actively transported into the nucleus instead. The nucleus of a typical mammalian cell will have about 3000 to 4000 pores throughout its envelope, each of which contains an eightfold-symmetric ring-shaped structure at a position where the inner and outer membranes fuse. Attached to the ring is a structure called the \"nuclear basket\" that extends into the nucleoplasm, and a series of filamentous extensions that reach into the cytoplasm. Both structures serve to mediate binding to nuclear transport proteins.\n\nMost proteins, ribosomal subunits, and some DNAs are transported through the pore complexes in a process mediated by a family of transport factors known as karyopherins. Those karyopherins that mediate movement into the nucleus are also called importins, whereas those that mediate movement out of the nucleus are called exportins. Most karyopherins interact directly with their cargo, although some use adaptor proteins. Steroid hormones such as cortisol and aldosterone, as well as other small lipid-soluble molecules involved in intercellular signaling, can diffuse through the cell membrane and into the cytoplasm, where they bind nuclear receptor proteins that are trafficked into the nucleus. There they serve as transcription factors when bound to their ligand; in the absence of a ligand, many such receptors function as histone deacetylases that repress gene expression.\n\nIn animal cells, two networks of intermediate filaments provide the nucleus with mechanical support: The nuclear lamina forms an organized meshwork on the internal face of the envelope, while less organized support is provided on the cytosolic face of the envelope. Both systems provide structural support for the nuclear envelope and anchoring sites for chromosomes and nuclear pores.\n\nThe nuclear lamina is composed mostly of lamin proteins. Like all proteins, lamins are synthesized in the cytoplasm and later transported to the nucleus interior, where they are assembled before being incorporated into the existing network of nuclear lamina. Lamins found on the cytosolic face of the membrane, such as emerin and nesprin, bind to the cytoskeleton to provide structural support. Lamins are also found inside the nucleoplasm where they form another regular structure, known as the \"nucleoplasmic veil\", that is visible using fluorescence microscopy. The actual function of the veil is not clear, although it is excluded from the nucleolus and is present during interphase. Lamin structures that make up the veil, such as LEM3, bind chromatin and disrupting their structure inhibits transcription of protein-coding genes.\n\nLike the components of other intermediate filaments, the lamin monomer contains an alpha-helical domain used by two monomers to coil around each other, forming a dimer structure called a coiled coil. Two of these dimer structures then join side by side, in an antiparallel arrangement, to form a tetramer called a \"protofilament\". Eight of these protofilaments form a lateral arrangement that is twisted to form a ropelike \"filament\". These filaments can be assembled or disassembled in a dynamic manner, meaning that changes in the length of the filament depend on the competing rates of filament addition and removal.\n\nMutations in lamin genes leading to defects in filament assembly cause a group of rare genetic disorders known as \"laminopathies\". The most notable laminopathy is the family of diseases known as progeria, which causes the appearance of premature aging in its sufferers. The exact mechanism by which the associated biochemical changes give rise to the aged phenotype is not well understood.\n\nThe cell nucleus contains the majority of the cell's genetic material in the form of multiple linear DNA molecules organized into structures called chromosomes. Each human cell contains roughly two meters of DNA. During most of the cell cycle these are organized in a DNA-protein complex known as chromatin, and during cell division the chromatin can be seen to form the well-defined chromosomes familiar from a karyotype. A small fraction of the cell's genes are located instead in the mitochondria.\n\nThere are two types of chromatin. Euchromatin is the less compact DNA form, and contains genes that are frequently expressed by the cell. The other type, heterochromatin, is the more compact form, and contains DNA that is infrequently transcribed. This structure is further categorized into \"facultative\" heterochromatin, consisting of genes that are organized as heterochromatin only in certain cell types or at certain stages of development, and \"constitutive\" heterochromatin that consists of chromosome structural components such as telomeres and centromeres. During interphase the chromatin organizes itself into discrete individual patches, called \"chromosome territories\". Active genes, which are generally found in the euchromatic region of the chromosome, tend to be located towards the chromosome's territory boundary.\n\nAntibodies to certain types of chromatin organization, in particular, nucleosomes, have been associated with a number of autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus. These are known as anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) and have also been observed in concert with multiple sclerosis as part of general immune system dysfunction. As in the case of progeria, the role played by the antibodies in inducing the symptoms of autoimmune diseases is not obvious.\n\nThe nucleolus is a discrete densely stained structure found in the nucleus. It is not surrounded by a membrane, and is sometimes called a \"suborganelle\". It forms around tandem repeats of rDNA, DNA coding for ribosomal RNA (rRNA). These regions are called nucleolar organizer regions (NOR). The main roles of the nucleolus are to synthesize rRNA and assemble ribosomes. The structural cohesion of the nucleolus depends on its activity, as ribosomal assembly in the nucleolus results in the transient association of nucleolar components, facilitating further ribosomal assembly, and hence further association. This model is supported by observations that inactivation of rDNA results in intermingling of nucleolar structures.\n\nIn the first step of ribosome assembly, a protein called RNA polymerase I transcribes rDNA, which forms a large pre-rRNA precursor. This is cleaved into the subunits 5.8S, 18S, and 28S rRNA. The transcription, post-transcriptional processing, and assembly of rRNA occurs in the nucleolus, aided by small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) molecules, some of which are derived from spliced introns from messenger RNAs encoding genes related to ribosomal function. The assembled ribosomal subunits are the largest structures passed through the nuclear pores.\n\nWhen observed under the electron microscope, the nucleolus can be seen to consist of three distinguishable regions: the innermost \"fibrillar centers\" (FCs), surrounded by the \"dense fibrillar component\" (DFC), which in turn is bordered by the \"granular component\" (GC). Transcription of the rDNA occurs either in the FC or at the FC-DFC boundary, and, therefore, when rDNA transcription in the cell is increased, more FCs are detected. Most of the cleavage and modification of rRNAs occurs in the DFC, while the latter steps involving protein assembly onto the ribosomal subunits occur in the GC.\n\nBesides the nucleolus, the nucleus contains a number of other non-membrane-delineated bodies. These include Cajal bodies, Gemini of coiled bodies, polymorphic interphase karyosomal association (PIKA), promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) bodies, paraspeckles, and splicing speckles. Although little is known about a number of these domains, they are significant in that they show that the nucleoplasm is not a uniform mixture, but rather contains organized functional subdomains.\n\nOther subnuclear structures appear as part of abnormal disease processes. For example, the presence of small intranuclear rods has been reported in some cases of nemaline myopathy. This condition typically results from mutations in actin, and the rods themselves consist of mutant actin as well as other cytoskeletal proteins.\n\nA nucleus typically contains between 1 and 10 compact structures called Cajal bodies or coiled bodies (CB), whose diameter measures between 0.2 µm and 2.0 µm depending on the cell type and species. When seen under an electron microscope, they resemble balls of tangled thread and are dense foci of distribution for the protein coilin. CBs are involved in a number of different roles relating to RNA processing, specifically small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) and small nuclear RNA (snRNA) maturation, and histone mRNA modification.\n\nSimilar to Cajal bodies are Gemini of Cajal bodies, or gems, whose name is derived from the Gemini constellation in reference to their close \"twin\" relationship with CBs. Gems are similar in size and shape to CBs, and in fact are virtually indistinguishable under the microscope. Unlike CBs, gems do not contain small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), but do contain a protein called survival of motor neuron (SMN) whose function relates to snRNP biogenesis. Gems are believed to assist CBs in snRNP biogenesis, though it has also been suggested from microscopy evidence that CBs and gems are different manifestations of the same structure. Later ultrastructural studies have shown gems to be twins of Cajal bodies with the difference being in the coilin component; Cajal bodies are SMN positive and coilin positive, and gems are SMN positive and coilin negative.\n\nRAFA domains, or polymorphic interphase karyosomal associations, were first described in microscopy studies in 1991. Their function remains unclear, though they were not thought to be associated with active DNA replication, transcription, or RNA processing. They have been found to often associate with discrete domains defined by dense localization of the transcription factor PTF, which promotes transcription of small nuclear RNA (snRNA).\n\nPromyelocytic leukaemia bodies (PML bodies) are spherical bodies found scattered throughout the nucleoplasm, measuring around 0.1–1.0 µm. They are known by a number of other names, including nuclear domain 10 (ND10), Kremer bodies, and PML oncogenic domains. PML bodies are named after one of their major components, the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML). They are often seen in the nucleus in association with Cajal bodies and cleavage bodies. PML bodies belong to the nuclear matrix, an ill-defined super-structure of the nucleus proposed to anchor and regulate many nuclear functions, including DNA replication, transcription, or epigenetic silencing. The PML protein is the key organizer of these domains that recruits an ever-growing number of proteins, whose only common known feature to date is their ability to be SUMOylated. Yet, pml-/- mice (which have their PML gene deleted) cannot assemble nuclear bodies, develop normally and live well, demonstrating that PML bodies are dispensable for most basic biological functions.\n\nSpeckles are subnuclear structures that are enriched in pre-messenger RNA splicing factors and are located in the interchromatin regions of the nucleoplasm of mammalian cells. At the fluorescence-microscope level they appear as irregular, punctate structures, which vary in size and shape, and when examined by electron microscopy they are seen as clusters of interchromatin granules. Speckles are dynamic structures, and both their protein and RNA-protein components can cycle continuously between speckles and other nuclear locations, including active transcription sites. Studies on the composition, structure and behaviour of speckles have provided a model for understanding the functional compartmentalization of the nucleus and the organization of the gene-expression machinery\nsplicing snRNPs and other splicing proteins necessary for pre-mRNA processing. Because of a cell's changing requirements, the composition and location of these bodies changes according to mRNA transcription and regulation via phosphorylation of specific proteins.\nThe splicing speckles are also known as nuclear speckles (nuclear specks), splicing factor compartments (SF compartments), interchromatin granule clusters (IGCs), B snurposomes.\nB snurposomes are found in the amphibian oocyte nuclei and in \"Drosophila melanogaster\" embryos. B snurposomes appear alone or attached to the Cajal bodies in the electron micrographs of the amphibian nuclei.\nIGCs function as storage sites for the splicing factors.\n\nDiscovered by Fox et al. in 2002, paraspeckles are irregularly shaped compartments in the nucleus' interchromatin space. First documented in HeLa cells, where there are generally 10–30 per nucleus, paraspeckles are now known to also exist in all human primary cells, transformed cell lines, and tissue sections. Their name is derived from their distribution in the nucleus; the \"para\" is short for parallel and the \"speckles\" refers to the splicing speckles to which they are always in close proximity.\n\nParaspeckles are dynamic structures that are altered in response to changes in cellular metabolic activity. They are transcription dependent and in the absence of RNA Pol II transcription, the paraspeckle disappears and all of its associated protein components (PSP1, p54nrb, PSP2, CFI(m)68, and PSF) form a crescent shaped perinucleolar cap in the nucleolus. This phenomenon is demonstrated during the cell cycle. In the cell cycle, paraspeckles are present during interphase and during all of mitosis except for telophase. During telophase, when the two daughter nuclei are formed, there is no RNA Pol II transcription so the protein components instead form a perinucleolar cap.\n\nPerichromatin fibrils are visible only under electron microscope. They are located next to the transcriptionally active chromatin and are hypothesized to be the sites of active pre-mRNA processing.\n\nThe nucleus provides a site for genetic transcription that is segregated from the location of translation in the cytoplasm, allowing levels of gene regulation that are not available to prokaryotes. The main function of the cell nucleus is to control gene expression and mediate the replication of DNA during the cell cycle.\n\nThe nucleus is an organelle found in eukaryotic cells. Inside its fully enclosed nuclear membrane, it contains the majority of the cell's genetic material. This material is organized as DNA molecules, along with a variety of proteins, to form chromosomes.\n\nThe nuclear envelope allows the nucleus to control its contents, and separate them from the rest of the cytoplasm where necessary. This is important for controlling processes on either side of the nuclear membrane. In most cases where a cytoplasmic process needs to be restricted, a key participant is removed to the nucleus, where it interacts with transcription factors to downregulate the production of certain enzymes in the pathway. This regulatory mechanism occurs in the case of glycolysis, a cellular pathway for breaking down glucose to produce energy. Hexokinase is an enzyme responsible for the first the step of glycolysis, forming glucose-6-phosphate from glucose. At high concentrations of fructose-6-phosphate, a molecule made later from glucose-6-phosphate, a regulator protein removes hexokinase to the nucleus, where it forms a transcriptional repressor complex with nuclear proteins to reduce the expression of genes involved in glycolysis.\n\nIn order to control which genes are being transcribed, the cell separates some transcription factor proteins responsible for regulating gene expression from physical access to the DNA until they are activated by other signaling pathways. This prevents even low levels of inappropriate gene expression. For example, in the case of NF-κB-controlled genes, which are involved in most inflammatory responses, transcription is induced in response to a signal pathway such as that initiated by the signaling molecule TNF-α, binds to a cell membrane receptor, resulting in the recruitment of signalling proteins, and eventually activating the transcription factor NF-κB. A nuclear localisation signal on the NF-κB protein allows it to be transported through the nuclear pore and into the nucleus, where it stimulates the transcription of the target genes.\n\nThe compartmentalization allows the cell to prevent translation of unspliced mRNA. Eukaryotic mRNA contains introns that must be removed before being translated to produce functional proteins. The splicing is done inside the nucleus before the mRNA can be accessed by ribosomes for translation. Without the nucleus, ribosomes would translate newly transcribed (unprocessed) mRNA, resulting in malformed and nonfunctional proteins.\n\nGene expression first involves transcription, in which DNA is used as a template to produce RNA. In the case of genes encoding proteins, that RNA produced from this process is messenger RNA (mRNA), which then needs to be translated by ribosomes to form a protein. As ribosomes are located outside the nucleus, mRNA produced needs to be exported.\n\nSince the nucleus is the site of transcription, it also contains a variety of proteins that either directly mediate transcription or are involved in regulating the process. These proteins include helicases, which unwind the double-stranded DNA molecule to facilitate access to it, RNA polymerases, which bind to the DNA promoter to synthesize the growing RNA molecule, topoisomerases, which change the amount of supercoiling in DNA, helping it wind and unwind, as well as a large variety of transcription factors that regulate expression.\n\nNewly synthesized mRNA molecules are known as primary transcripts or pre-mRNA. They must undergo post-transcriptional modification in the nucleus before being exported to the cytoplasm; mRNA that appears in the cytoplasm without these modifications is degraded rather than used for protein translation. The three main modifications are 5' capping, 3' polyadenylation, and RNA splicing. While in the nucleus, pre-mRNA is associated with a variety of proteins in complexes known as heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein particles (hnRNPs). Addition of the 5' cap occurs co-transcriptionally and is the first step in post-transcriptional modification. The 3' poly-adenine tail is only added after transcription is complete.\n\nRNA splicing, carried out by a complex called the spliceosome, is the process by which introns, or regions of DNA that do not code for protein, are removed from the pre-mRNA and the remaining exons connected to re-form a single continuous molecule. This process normally occurs after 5' capping and 3' polyadenylation but can begin before synthesis is complete in transcripts with many exons. Many pre-mRNAs, including those encoding antibodies, can be spliced in multiple ways to produce different mature mRNAs that encode different protein sequences. This process is known as alternative splicing, and allows production of a large variety of proteins from a limited amount of DNA.\n\nThe entry and exit of large molecules from the nucleus is tightly controlled by the nuclear pore complexes. Although small molecules can enter the nucleus without regulation, macromolecules such as RNA and proteins require association karyopherins called importins to enter the nucleus and exportins to exit. \"Cargo\" proteins that must be translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus contain short amino acid sequences known as nuclear localization signals, which are bound by importins, while those transported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm carry nuclear export signals bound by exportins. The ability of importins and exportins to transport their cargo is regulated by GTPases, enzymes that hydrolyze the molecule guanosine triphosphate to release energy. The key GTPase in nuclear transport is Ran, which can bind either GTP or GDP (guanosine diphosphate), depending on whether it is located in the nucleus or the cytoplasm. Whereas importins depend on RanGTP to dissociate from their cargo, exportins require RanGTP in order to bind to their cargo.\n\nNuclear import depends on the importin binding its cargo in the cytoplasm and carrying it through the nuclear pore into the nucleus. Inside the nucleus, RanGTP acts to separate the cargo from the importin, allowing the importin to exit the nucleus and be reused. Nuclear export is similar, as the exportin binds the cargo inside the nucleus in a process facilitated by RanGTP, exits through the nuclear pore, and separates from its cargo in the cytoplasm.\n\nSpecialized export proteins exist for translocation of mature mRNA and tRNA to the cytoplasm after post-transcriptional modification is complete. This quality-control mechanism is important due to these molecules' central role in protein translation. Mis-expression of a protein due to incomplete excision of exons or mis-incorporation of amino acids could have negative consequences for the cell; thus, incompletely modified RNA that reaches the cytoplasm is degraded rather than used in translation.\n\nDuring its lifetime, a nucleus may be broken down or destroyed, either in the process of cell division or as a consequence of apoptosis (the process of programmed cell death). During these events, the structural components of the nucleus — the envelope and lamina — can be systematically degraded.\nIn most cells, the disassembly of the nuclear envelope marks the end of the prophase of mitosis. However, this disassembly of the nucleus is not a universal feature of mitosis and does not occur in all cells. Some unicellular eukaryotes (e.g., yeasts) undergo so-called closed mitosis, in which the nuclear envelope remains intact. In closed mitosis, the daughter chromosomes migrate to opposite poles of the nucleus, which then divides in two. The cells of higher eukaryotes, however, usually undergo open mitosis, which is characterized by breakdown of the nuclear envelope. The daughter chromosomes then migrate to opposite poles of the mitotic spindle, and new nuclei reassemble around them.\n\nAt a certain point during the cell cycle in open mitosis, the cell divides to form two cells. In order for this process to be possible, each of the new daughter cells must have a full set of genes, a process requiring replication of the chromosomes as well as segregation of the separate sets. This occurs by the replicated chromosomes, the sister chromatids, attaching to microtubules, which in turn are attached to different centrosomes. The sister chromatids can then be pulled to separate locations in the cell. In many cells, the centrosome is located in the cytoplasm, outside the nucleus; the microtubules would be unable to attach to the chromatids in the presence of the nuclear envelope. Therefore, the early stages in the cell cycle, beginning in prophase and until around prometaphase, the nuclear membrane is dismantled. Likewise, during the same period, the nuclear lamina is also disassembled, a process regulated by phosphorylation of the lamins by protein kinases such as the CDC2 protein kinase. Towards the end of the cell cycle, the nuclear membrane is reformed, and around the same time, the nuclear lamina are reassembled by dephosphorylating the lamins.\n\nHowever, in dinoflagellates, the nuclear envelope remains intact, the centrosomes are located in the cytoplasm, and the microtubules come in contact with chromosomes, whose centromeric regions are incorporated into the nuclear envelope (the so-called closed mitosis with extranuclear spindle). In many other protists (e.g., ciliates, sporozoans) and fungi, the centrosomes are intranuclear, and their nuclear envelope also does not disassemble during cell division.\n\nApoptosis is a controlled process in which the cell's structural components are destroyed, resulting in death of the cell. Changes associated with apoptosis directly affect the nucleus and its contents, for example, in the condensation of chromatin and the disintegration of the nuclear envelope and lamina. The destruction of the lamin networks is controlled by specialized apoptotic proteases called caspases, which cleave the lamin proteins and, thus, degrade the nucleus' structural integrity. Lamin cleavage is sometimes used as a laboratory indicator of caspase activity in assays for early apoptotic activity. Cells that express mutant caspase-resistant lamins are deficient in nuclear changes related to apoptosis, suggesting that lamins play a role in initiating the events that lead to apoptotic degradation of the nucleus. Inhibition of lamin assembly itself is an inducer of apoptosis.\n\nThe nuclear envelope acts as a barrier that prevents both DNA and RNA viruses from entering the nucleus. Some viruses require access to proteins inside the nucleus in order to replicate and/or assemble. DNA viruses, such as herpesvirus replicate and assemble in the cell nucleus, and exit by budding through the inner nuclear membrane. This process is accompanied by disassembly of the lamina on the nuclear face of the inner membrane.\n\nInitially, it has been suspected that immunoglobulins in general and autoantibodies in particular do not enter the nucleus. Now there is a body of evidence that under pathological conditions (e.g. lupus erythematosus) IgG can enter the nucleus.\n\nMost eukaryotic cell types usually have a single nucleus, but some have no nuclei, while others have several. This can result from normal development, as in the maturation of mammalian red blood cells, or from faulty cell division.\n\nAn anucleated cell contains no nucleus and is, therefore, incapable of dividing to produce daughter cells. The best-known anucleated cell is the mammalian red blood cell, or erythrocyte, which also lacks other organelles such as mitochondria, and serves primarily as a transport vessel to ferry oxygen from the lungs to the body's tissues. Erythrocytes mature through erythropoiesis in the bone marrow, where they lose their nuclei, organelles, and ribosomes. The nucleus is expelled during the process of differentiation from an erythroblast to a reticulocyte, which is the immediate precursor of the mature erythrocyte. The presence of mutagens may induce the release of some immature \"micronucleated\" erythrocytes into the bloodstream. Anucleated cells can also arise from flawed cell division in which one daughter lacks a nucleus and the other has two nuclei.\n\nIn flowering plants, this condition occurs in sieve tube elements.\n\nMultinucleated cells contain multiple nuclei. Most acantharean species of protozoa and some fungi in mycorrhizae have naturally multinucleated cells. Other examples include the intestinal parasites in the genus \"Giardia\", which have two nuclei per cell. In humans, skeletal muscle cells, called myocytes and syncytium, become multinucleated during development; the resulting arrangement of nuclei near the periphery of the cells allows maximal intracellular space for myofibrils. Multinucleated and binucleated cells can also be abnormal in humans; for example, cells arising from the fusion of monocytes and macrophages, known as giant multinucleated cells, sometimes accompany inflammation and are also implicated in tumor formation.\n\nA number of dinoflagellates are known to have two nuclei. Unlike other multinucleated cells these nuclei contain two distinct lineages of DNA: one from the dinoflagellate and the other from a symbiotic diatom. The mitochondria and the plastids of the diatom somehow remain functional.\n\nAs the major defining characteristic of the eukaryotic cell, the nucleus' evolutionary origin has been the subject of much speculation. Four major hypotheses have been proposed to explain the existence of the nucleus, although none have yet earned widespread support.\n\nThe first model known as the \"syntrophic model\" proposes that a symbiotic relationship between the archaea and bacteria created the nucleus-containing eukaryotic cell. (Organisms of the Archaea and Bacteria domain have no cell nucleus.) It is hypothesized that the symbiosis originated when ancient archaea, similar to modern methanogenic archaea, invaded and lived within bacteria similar to modern myxobacteria, eventually forming the early nucleus. This theory is analogous to the accepted theory for the origin of eukaryotic mitochondria and chloroplasts, which are thought to have developed from a similar endosymbiotic relationship between proto-eukaryotes and aerobic bacteria. The archaeal origin of the nucleus is supported by observations that archaea and eukarya have similar genes for certain proteins, including histones. Observations that myxobacteria are motile, can form multicellular complexes, and possess kinases and G proteins similar to eukarya, support a bacterial origin for the eukaryotic cell.\n\nA second model proposes that proto-eukaryotic cells evolved from bacteria without an endosymbiotic stage. This model is based on the existence of modern planctomycetes bacteria that possess a nuclear structure with primitive pores and other compartmentalized membrane structures. A similar proposal states that a eukaryote-like cell, the chronocyte, evolved first and phagocytosed archaea and bacteria to generate the nucleus and the eukaryotic cell.\n\nThe most controversial model, known as \"viral eukaryogenesis\", posits that the membrane-bound nucleus, along with other eukaryotic features, originated from the infection of a prokaryote by a virus. The suggestion is based on similarities between eukaryotes and viruses such as linear DNA strands, mRNA capping, and tight binding to proteins (analogizing histones to viral envelopes). One version of the proposal suggests that the nucleus evolved in concert with phagocytosis to form an early cellular \"predator\". Another variant proposes that eukaryotes originated from early archaea infected by poxviruses, on the basis of observed similarity between the DNA polymerases in modern poxviruses and eukaryotes. It has been suggested that the unresolved question of the evolution of sex could be related to the viral eukaryogenesis hypothesis.\n\nA more recent proposal, the \"exomembrane hypothesis\", suggests that the nucleus instead originated from a single ancestral cell that evolved a second exterior cell membrane; the interior membrane enclosing the original cell then became the nuclear membrane and evolved increasingly elaborate pore structures for passage of internally synthesized cellular components such as ribosomal subunits.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6237", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6237", "title": "Christmas", "text": "Christmas\n\nChristmas is an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ, observed most commonly on December 25 as a religious and cultural celebration among billions of people around the world. A feast central to the Christian liturgical year, it is prepared for by the season of Advent or the Nativity Fast and initiates the season of Christmastide, which historically in the West lasts twelve days and culminates on Twelfth Night; in some traditions, Christmastide includes an Octave. The traditional Christmas narrative, the Nativity of Jesus, delineated in the New Testament says that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, in accordance with messianic prophecies; when Joseph and Mary arrived in the city, the inn had no room and so they were offered a stable where the Christ Child was soon born, with angels proclaiming this news to shepherds who then disseminated the message furthermore. Christmas Day is a public holiday in many of the world's nations, is celebrated religiously by the vast majority of Christians, as well as culturally by a number of non-Christian people, and is an integral part of the holiday season, while some Christian groups reject the celebration. In several countries, celebrating Christmas Eve on December 24 has the main focus rather than December 25, with gift-giving and sharing a traditional meal with the family.\n\nAlthough the month and date of Jesus' birth are unknown, by the early-to-mid fourth century the Western Christian Church had placed Christmas on December 25, a date that was later adopted in the East. Today, most Christians celebrate on December 25 in the Gregorian calendar, which has been adopted almost universally in the civil calendars used in countries throughout the world. However, some Eastern Christian Churches celebrate Christmas on December 25 of the older Julian calendar, which currently corresponds to January 7 in the Gregorian calendar, the day after the Western Christian Church celebrates the Epiphany. This is not a disagreement over the date of Christmas as such, but rather a preference of which calendar should be used to determine the day that is December 25. In the Council of Tours of 567, the Church, with its desire to be universal, \"declared the twelve days between Christmas and Epiphany to be one unified festal cycle\", thus giving significance to both the Western and Eastern dates of Christmas. Moreover, for Christians, the belief that God came into the world in the form of man to atone for the sins of humanity, rather than the exact birth date, is considered to be the primary purpose in celebrating Christmas.\n\nAlthough it is not known why December 25 became a date of celebration, there are several factors that may have influenced the choice. December 25 was the date the Romans marked as the winter solstice, the shortest, and therefore darkest day of the year. Jesus was identified with the Sun based on an Old Testament verse. The date is exactly nine months following Annunciation, when the conception of Jesus is celebrated. Finally, the Romans had a series of pagan festivals near the end of the year, so Christmas may have been scheduled at this time to appropriate, or compete with, one or more of these festivals. Other scholars disagree with this claim and state that the Roman Emperor Aurelian placed a pagan celebration on December 25 in order to compete with the growing rate of the Christian Church, which had already been celebrating Christmas on that date.\n\nThe celebratory customs associated in various countries with Christmas have a mix of pre-Christian, Christian, and secular themes and origins. Popular modern customs of the holiday include gift giving, completing an Advent calendar or Advent wreath, Christmas music and caroling, lighting a Christingle, viewing a Nativity play, an exchange of Christmas cards, church services, a special meal, and the display of various Christmas decorations, including Christmas trees, Christmas lights, nativity scenes, garlands, wreaths, mistletoe, and holly. In addition, several closely related and often interchangeable figures, known as Santa Claus, Father Christmas, Saint Nicholas, and Christkind, are associated with bringing gifts to children during the Christmas season and have their own body of traditions and lore. Because gift-giving and many other aspects of the Christmas festival involve heightened economic activity, the holiday has become a significant event and a key sales period for retailers and businesses. The economic impact of Christmas has grown steadily over the past few centuries in many regions of the world.\n\n\"Christmas\" is a shortened form of \"Christ's mass\". It is derived from the Middle English \"Cristemasse\", which is from Old English \"Crīstesmæsse\", a phrase first recorded in 1038 followed by the word \"Cristes-messe\" in 1131. \"Crīst\" (genitive \"Crīstes\") is from Greek \"Khrīstos\" (Χριστός), a translation of Hebrew \"Māšîaḥ\" (מָשִׁיחַ), \"Messiah\", meaning \"anointed\"; and \"mæsse\" is from Latin \"missa\", the celebration of the Eucharist. The form \"Christenmas\" was also historically used, but is now considered archaic and dialectal; it derives from Middle English \"Cristenmasse\", literally \"Christian mass\". \"Xmas\" is an abbreviation of \"Christmas\" found particularly in print, based on the initial letter chi (Χ) in Greek \"Khrīstos\" (Χριστός), \"Christ\", though numerous style guides discourage its use; it has precedent in Middle English \"Χρ̄es masse\" (where \"Χρ̄\" is an abbreviation for Χριστός).\n\nIn addition to \"Christmas\", the holiday has been known by various other names throughout its history. The Anglo-Saxons referred to the feast as \"midwinter\", or, more rarely, as \"Nātiuiteð\" (from Latin \"nātīvitās\" below). \"Nativity\", meaning \"birth\", is from Latin \"nātīvitās\". In Old English, \"Gēola\" (\"Yule\") referred to the period corresponding to December and January, which was eventually equated with Christian Christmas. \"Noel\" (or \"Nowel\") entered English in the late 14th century and is from the Old French \"noël\" or \"naël\", itself ultimately from the Latin \"nātālis (diēs)\" meaning \"birth (day)\".\n\nThe canonical gospels of Luke and Matthew both describe Jesus as being born in Bethlehem in Judea, to a virgin mother. In the Gospel of Luke account, Joseph and Mary travel from Nazareth to Bethlehem for the census, and Jesus is born there and laid in a manger. It says that angels proclaimed him a savior for all people, and shepherds came to adore him. In the Matthew account, magi follow a star to Bethlehem to bring gifts to Jesus, born the king of the Jews. King Herod orders the massacre of all the boys less than two years old in Bethlehem, but the family flees to Egypt and later settles in Nazareth.\n\nThe Nativity stories of Matthew and Luke are prominent in the gospels and early Christian writers suggested various dates for the anniversary. The first recorded Christmas celebration was in Rome in 336. Christmas played a role in the Arian controversy of the fourth century. In the early Middle Ages, it was overshadowed by Epiphany. The feast regained prominence after 800, when Charlemagne was crowned emperor on Christmas Day. Associating it with drunkenness and other misbehavior, the Puritans banned Christmas in the 17th century. It was restored as a legal holiday in 1660, but remained disreputable. In the early 19th century, Christmas was revived with the start of the Oxford Movement in the Anglican Church. Charles Dickens and other writers reinvented the holiday by emphasizing Christmas as a time for family, religion, gift-giving, and social reconciliation as opposed to the revelry that had been common historically.\nIn the 3rd century, the date of birth of Jesus was the subject of both great interest and great uncertainly. Around AD 200, Clement of Alexandria wrote:\nIn other writing of this time, May 20, April 18 or 19, March 25, January 2, November 17, and November 20 are all suggested. Various factors contributed to the selection of December 25 as a date of celebration: it was the date of the winter solstice on the Roman calendar; it was about nine months after March 25, the date of the vernal equinox and a date linked to the conception of Jesus. It was also the date of a Roman pagan festival in honor of the Sun god Sol Invictus.\n\nDecember 25 was the date of the winter solstice on the Roman calendar. Jesus chose to be born on the shortest day of the year for symbolic reasons, according to an early Christmas sermon by Augustine: \"Hence it is that He was born on the day which is the shortest in our earthly reckoning and from which subsequent days begin to increase in length. He, therefore, who bent low and lifted us up chose the shortest day, yet the one whence light begins to increase.\"\n\nLinking Jesus to the Sun was supported by various Biblical passages. Jesus was considered to be the \"Sun of righteousness\" prophesied by Malachi: \"Unto you shall the sun of righteousness arise, and healing is in his wings.\" John describes Jesus as \"the light of the world.\"\n\nSuch solar symbolism could support more than one date of birth. An anonymous work known as \"De Pascha Computus\" (243) linked the idea that creation began at the spring equinox, on March 25, with the conception or birth (the word \"nascor\" can mean either) of Jesus on March 28, the day of the creation of the sun in the Genesis account. One translation reads: \"O the splendid and divine providence of the Lord, that on that day, the very day, on which the sun was made, the 28 March, a Wednesday, Christ should be born.\n\nIn the 17th century, Isaac Newton argued that the date of Christmas was selected to correspond with the solstice.\n\nAccording to Steven Hijmans of the University of Alberta, \"It is cosmic symbolism ... which inspired the Church leadership in Rome to elect the southern solstice, December 25, as the birthday of Christ, and the northern solstice as that of John the Baptist, supplemented by the equinoxes as their respective dates of conception.\"\n\nThe Calculation hypothesis suggests that an earlier holiday held on March 25 became associated with the Incarnation. Modern scholars refer to this feast as the Quartodecimal. Christmas was then calculated as nine months later. The Calculation hypothesis was proposed by French writer Louis Duchesne in 1889.\n\nIn modern times, March 25 is celebrated as Annunciation. This holiday was created in the seventh century and was assigned to a date that is nine months before Christmas, in addition to being the traditional date of the equinox. It is unrelated to the Quartodecimal, which had been forgotten by this time.\n\nEarly Christians celebrated the life of Jesus on a date considered equivalent to 14 Nisan (Passover) on the local calendar. Because Passover was held on the 14th of the month, this feast is referred to as the Quartodecimal. All the major events of Christ's life, especially the passion, were celebrated on this date. In his letter to the Corinthians, Paul mentions Passover, presumably celebrated according to the local calendar in Corinth. Tertullian (d. 220), who lived in Latin-speaking North Africa, gives the date of passion celebration as March 25. The date of the passion was moved to Good Friday in 165 when Pope Soter created Easter by reassigning the Resurrection to a Sunday. According to the Calculation hypothesis, celebration of the quartodecimal continued in some areas and the feast became associated with Incarnation.\n\nThe Calculation hypothesis is considered academically to be \"a thoroughly viable hypothesis\", though not certain. It was a traditional Jewish belief that great men lived a whole number of years, without fractions, so that Jesus was considered to have been conceived on March 25, as he died on March 25, which was calculated to have coincided with 14 Nisan.\n\nA passage in \"Commentary on the Prophet Daniel\" (204) by Hippolytus of Rome identifies December 25 as the date of the nativity. This passage is generally considered a late interpellation. The manuscript includes another passage, one that is more likely to be authentic, that gives the passion as March 25.\n\nIn 221, Sextus Julius Africanus (c. 160 – c. 240) gave March 25 as the day of creation and of the conception of Jesus in his universal history. This conclusion was based on solar symbolism, with March 25 the date of the equinox. As this implies a birth in December, it is sometimes claimed to be the earliest identification of December 25 as the nativity. However, Africanus was not such an influential writer that it is likely he determined the date of Christmas.\n\nThe tractate \"De solstitia et aequinoctia conceptionis et nativitatis Domini nostri Iesu Christi et Iohannis Baptistae,\" falsely attributed to John Chrysostom, also argued that Jesus was conceived and crucified on the same day of the year and calculated this as March 25. This anonymous tract also states: \"But Our Lord, too, is born in the month of December ... the eight before the calends of January [25 December] ..., But they call it the 'Birthday of the Unconquered'. Who indeed is so unconquered as Our Lord...? Or, if they say that it is the birthday of the Sun, He is the Sun of Justice.\"\n\nThe rival \"History of Religions\" hypothesis suggests that the Church selected December 25 date to appropriate festivities held by the Romans in honor of the Sun god Sol Invictus. This feast was established by Aurelian in 274.\n\nAn explicit expression of this theory appears in an annotation of uncertain date added to a manuscript of a work by 12th-century Syrian bishop Jacob Bar-Salibi. The scribe who added it wrote: \"It was a custom of the Pagans to celebrate on the same 25 December the birthday of the Sun, at which they kindled lights in token of festivity. In these solemnities and revelries the Christians also took part. Accordingly when the doctors of the Church perceived that the Christians had a leaning to this festival, they took counsel and resolved that the true Nativity should be solemnised on that day.\" \n\nIn 1743, German Protestant Paul Ernst Jablonski argued Christmas was placed on December 25 to correspond with the Roman solar holiday \"Dies Natalis Solis Invicti\" and was therefore a \"paganization\" that debased the true church. It has been argued that, on the contrary, the Emperor Aurelian, who in 274 instituted the holiday of the \"Dies Natalis Solis Invicti\", did so partly as an attempt to give a pagan significance to a date already important for Christians in Rome.\n\nHermann Usener and others proposed that the Christians chose this day because it was the Roman feast celebrating the birthday of Sol Invictus. Modern scholar S. E. Hijmans, however, states that \"While they were aware that pagans called this day the 'birthday' of Sol Invictus, this did not concern them and it did not play any role in their choice of date for Christmas.\" Moreover, Thomas J. Talley holds that the Roman Emperor Aurelian placed a Sol Invictus on December 25 in order to compete with the growing rate of the Christian Church, which had already been celebrating Christmas on that date first.\n\nIn the judgement of the Church of England Liturgical Commission, the History of Religions hypothesis has been challenged by a view based on an old tradition, according to which the date of Christmas was fixed at nine months after March 25, the date of the vernal equinox, on which the Annunciation was celebrated.\n\nWith regard to a December religious feast of the sun as a god (Sol), as distinct from a solstice feast of the (re)birth of the astronomical sun, one scholar has commented that, \"while the winter solstice on or around December 25 was well established in the Roman imperial calendar, there is no evidence that a religious celebration of Sol on that day antedated the celebration of Christmas\". \"Thomas Talley has shown that, although the Emperor Aurelian's dedication of a temple to the sun god in the Campus Martius (C.E. 274) probably took place on the 'Birthday of the Invincible Sun' on December 25, the cult of the sun in pagan Rome ironically did not celebrate the winter solstice nor any of the other quarter-tense days, as one might expect.\" The \"Oxford Companion to Christian Thought\" remarks on the uncertainty about the order of precedence between the religious celebrations of the Birthday of the Unconquered Sun and of the birthday of Jesus, stating that the hypothesis that December 25 was chosen for celebrating the birth of Jesus on the basis of the belief that his conception occurred on March 25 \"potentially establishes 25 December as a Christian festival before Aurelian's decree, which, when promulgated, might have provided for the Christian feast both opportunity and challenge\".\n\nAs Christmas was unknown to the early Christian writers, it must have been introduced sometime after 300. Irenaeus and Tertullian omit it from their lists of feasts, and Origen writes that in the Scriptures sinners alone, not saints, celebrate their birthday. Arnobius can still ridicule the \"birthdays\" of the gods. The first recorded Christmas celebration was in Rome in 336. The feast was introduced to the Eastern Roman Empire after the death of Emperor Valens, who favored the Arian heresy, in 378.\n\nIn 245, Origen of Alexandria, writing about , commented that Scripture mentions only sinners as \"celebrating\" their birthdays, namely Pharaoh, who then had his chief baker hanged (), and Herod, who then had John the Baptist beheaded (), and mentions saints as \"cursing\" the day of their birth, namely Jeremiah () and Job (). In 303, Arnobius ridiculed the idea of celebrating the birthdays of gods, a passage cited as evidence that Arnobius was unaware of any nativity celebration. Since Christmas does not celebrate Christ's birth \"as God\" but \"as man\", this does not necessarily show that Christmas was not a feast at this time.\n\nThe fact the Donatists of North Africa celebrated Christmas suggests that the feast was established by the time that church was created in 311. The earliest known Christmas celebration is recorded in a fourth-century manuscript compiled in Rome. This manuscript is thought to record a celebration that occurred in 336. It was prepared privately for Filocalus, a Roman aristocrat, in 354. The reference in question states, \"VIII kal. ian. natus Christus in Betleem Iudeæ\". This reference is in a section of the manuscript that was copied from earlier source material. The document also contains the earliest known reference to the feast of Sol Invictus.\n\nIn Eastern Christianity the birth of Jesus was already celebrated in connection with the Epiphany on January 6. Epiphany emphasized celebration of the baptism of Jesus. December 25 celebration was imported into the East later: in Antioch by John Chrysostom towards the end of the fourth century, probably in 388, and in Alexandria only in the following century. Even in the West, January 6 celebration of the nativity of Jesus seems to have continued until after 380.\n\nIn the East, early Christians celebrated the birth of Christ as part of Epiphany (January 6), although Christmas was promoted in the Christian East as part of the revival of Nicene Christianity following the death of the pro-Arian Emperor Valens at the Battle of Adrianople in 378. The feast was introduced at Constantinople in 379, and at Antioch in about 380. The feast disappeared after Gregory of Nazianzus resigned as bishop in 381, although it was reintroduced by John Chrysostom in about 400.\n\nMany popular customs associated with Christmas developed independently of the commemoration of Jesus' birth, with certain elements having origins in pre-Christian festivals that were celebrated around the winter solstice by pagan populations who were later converted to Christianity. These elements, including the Yule log from Yule and gift giving from Saturnalia, became syncretized into Christmas over the centuries. The prevailing atmosphere of Christmas has also continually evolved since the holiday's inception, ranging from a sometimes raucous, drunken, carnival-like state in the Middle Ages, to a tamer family-oriented and children-centered theme introduced in a 19th-century transformation. Additionally, the celebration of Christmas was banned on more than one occasion within certain Protestant groups, such as the Puritans, due to concerns that it was too pagan or unbiblical. Jehovah's Witnesses also reject the celebration of Christmas.\n\nPrior to and through the early Christian centuries, winter festivals—especially those centered on the winter solstice—were the most popular of the year in many European pagan cultures. Reasons included the fact that less agricultural work needed to be done during the winter, as well as an expectation of better weather as spring approached. Many modern Christmas customs have been directly influenced by such festivals, including gift-giving and merrymaking from the Roman Saturnalia, greenery, lights, and charity from the Roman New Year, and Yule logs and various foods from Germanic feasts. The Egyptian deity Horus, son to goddess Isis, was celebrated at the winter solstice. Horus was often depicted being fed by his mother, which also influenced the symbolism of the Virgin Mary with baby Christ.\n\nThe pre-Christian Germanic peoples—including the Anglo-Saxons and the Norse—celebrated a winter festival called Yule, held in the late December to early January period, yielding modern English \"yule\", today used as a synonym for \"Christmas\". In Germanic language-speaking areas, numerous elements of modern Christmas folk custom and iconography stem from Yule, including the Yule log, Yule boar, and the Yule goat. Often leading a ghostly procession through the sky (the Wild Hunt), the long-bearded god Odin is referred to as \"the Yule one\" and \"Yule father\" in Old Norse texts, whereas the rest of the gods are referred to as \"Yule beings\".\n\nIn eastern Europe also, old pagan traditions were incorporated into Christmas celebrations, an example being the Koleda, which was incorporated into the Christmas carol.\n\nIn the Early Middle Ages, Christmas Day was overshadowed by Epiphany, which in western Christianity focused on the visit of the magi. But the medieval calendar was dominated by Christmas-related holidays. The forty days before Christmas became the \"forty days of St. Martin\" (which began on November 11, the feast of St. Martin of Tours), now known as Advent. In Italy, former Saturnalian traditions were attached to Advent. Around the 12th century, these traditions transferred again to the Twelve Days of Christmas (December 25 – January 5); a time that appears in the liturgical calendars as Christmastide or Twelve Holy Days.\n\nThe prominence of Christmas Day increased gradually after Charlemagne was crowned Emperor on Christmas Day in 800. King Edmund the Martyr was anointed on Christmas in 855 and King William I of England was crowned on Christmas Day 1066.\n\nBy the High Middle Ages, the holiday had become so prominent that chroniclers routinely noted where various magnates celebrated Christmas. King Richard II of England hosted a Christmas feast in 1377 at which twenty-eight oxen and three hundred sheep were eaten. The Yule boar was a common feature of medieval Christmas feasts. Caroling also became popular, and was originally a group of dancers who sang. The group was composed of a lead singer and a ring of dancers that provided the chorus. Various writers of the time condemned caroling as lewd, indicating that the unruly traditions of Saturnalia and Yule may have continued in this form. \"Misrule\"—drunkenness, promiscuity, gambling—was also an important aspect of the festival. In England, gifts were exchanged on New Year's Day, and there was special Christmas ale.\n\nChristmas during the Middle Ages was a public festival that incorporated ivy, holly, and other evergreens. Christmas gift-giving during the Middle Ages was usually between people with legal relationships, such as tenant and landlord. The annual indulgence in eating, dancing, singing, sporting, and card playing escalated in England, and by the 17th century the Christmas season featured lavish dinners, elaborate masques, and pageants. In 1607, King James I insisted that a play be acted on Christmas night and that the court indulge in games. It was during the Reformation in 16th–17th-century Europe that many Protestants changed the gift bringer to the Christ Child or \"Christkindl\", and the date of giving gifts changed from December 6 to Christmas Eve.\n\nFollowing the Protestant Reformation, many of the new denominations, including the Anglican Church and Lutheran Church, continued to celebrate Christmas. In 1629, the Anglican poet John Milton penned \"On the Morning of Christ's Nativity\", a poem that has since been read by many during Christmastide. Donald Heinz, a professor at California State University, states that Martin Luther \"inaugurated a period in which Germany would produce a unique culture of Christmas, much copied in North America.\" Among the congregations of the Dutch Reformed Church, Christmas was celebrated as one of the principal evangelical feasts.\n\nHowever, in 17th century England, some groups such as the Puritans, strongly condemned the celebration of Christmas, considering it a Catholic invention and the \"trappings of popery\" or the \"rags of the Beast\". In contrast, the established Anglican Church \"pressed for a more elaborate observance of feasts, penitential seasons, and saints' days. The calendar reform became a major point of tension between the Anglican party and the Puritan party.\" The Catholic Church also responded, promoting the festival in a more religiously oriented form. King Charles I of England directed his noblemen and gentry to return to their landed estates in midwinter to keep up their old-style Christmas generosity. Following the Parliamentarian victory over Charles I during the English Civil War, England's Puritan rulers banned Christmas in 1647.\n\nProtests followed as pro-Christmas rioting broke out in several cities and for weeks Canterbury was controlled by the rioters, who decorated doorways with holly and shouted royalist slogans. The book, \"The Vindication of Christmas\" (London, 1652), argued against the Puritans, and makes note of Old English Christmas traditions, dinner, roast apples on the fire, card playing, dances with \"plow-boys\" and \"maidservants\", old Father Christmas and carol singing.\nThe Restoration of King Charles II in 1660 ended the ban, but many Calvinist clergymen still disapproved of Christmas celebration. As such, in Scotland, the Presbyterian Church of Scotland discouraged the observance of Christmas, and though James VI commanded its celebration in 1618, attendance at church was scant. The Parliament of Scotland officially abolished the observance of Christmas in 1640, claiming that the church had been \"purged of all superstitious observation of days\". It was not until 1958 that Christmas again became a Scottish public holiday.\n\nFollowing the Restoration of Charles II, \"Poor Robin's Almanack\" contained the lines: \"Now thanks to God for Charles return, / Whose absence made old Christmas mourn. / For then we scarcely did it know, / Whether it Christmas were or no.\" The diary of James Woodforde, from the latter half of the 18th century, details the observance of Christmas and celebrations associated with the season over a number of years.\n\nIn Colonial America, the Pilgrims of New England shared radical Protestant disapproval of Christmas. The Plymouth Pilgrims put their loathing for the day into practice in 1620 when they spent their first Christmas Day in the New World working – thus demonstrating their complete contempt for the day. Non-Puritans in New England deplored the loss of the holidays enjoyed by the laboring classes in England. Christmas observance was outlawed in Boston in 1659. The ban by the Puritans was revoked in 1681 by English governor Edmund Andros, however it was not until the mid-19th century that celebrating Christmas became fashionable in the Boston region.\n\nAt the same time, Christian residents of Virginia and New York observed the holiday freely. Pennsylvania German Settlers, pre-eminently the Moravian settlers of Bethlehem, Nazareth and Lititz in Pennsylvania and the Wachovia Settlements in North Carolina, were enthusiastic celebrators of Christmas. The Moravians in Bethlehem had the first Christmas trees in America as well as the first Nativity Scenes. Christmas fell out of favor in the United States after the American Revolution, when it was considered an English custom.\nGeorge Washington attacked Hessian (German) mercenaries on the day after Christmas during the Battle of Trenton on December 26, 1776, Christmas being much more popular in Germany than in America at this time.\n\nWith the atheistic Cult of Reason in power during the era of Revolutionary France, Christian Christmas religious services were banned and the three kings cake was renamed the \"equality cake\" under anticlerical government policies.\n\nIn the UK, Christmas Day became a bank holiday in 1834, Boxing Day was added in 1871.\n\nIn the early-19th century, writers imagined Tudor Christmas as a time of heartfelt celebration. In 1843, Charles Dickens wrote the novel \"A Christmas Carol\" that helped revive the \"spirit\" of Christmas and seasonal merriment. Its instant popularity played a major role in portraying Christmas as a holiday emphasizing family, goodwill, and compassion.\n\nDickens sought to construct Christmas as a family-centered festival of generosity, linking \"worship and feasting, within a context of social reconciliation.\" Superimposing his humanitarian vision of the holiday, in what has been termed \"Carol Philosophy\", Dickens influenced many aspects of Christmas that are celebrated today in Western culture, such as family gatherings, seasonal food and drink, dancing, games, and a festive generosity of spirit. A prominent phrase from the tale, \"Merry Christmas\", was popularized following the appearance of the story. This coincided with the appearance of the Oxford Movement and the growth of Anglo-Catholicism, which led a revival in traditional rituals and religious observances.\nThe term Scrooge became a synonym for miser, with \"Bah! Humbug!\" dismissive of the festive spirit. In 1843, the first commercial Christmas card was produced by Sir Henry Cole. The revival of the Christmas Carol began with William Sandys's \"Christmas Carols Ancient and Modern\" (1833), with the first appearance in print of \"The First Noel\", \"I Saw Three Ships\", \"Hark the Herald Angels Sing\" and \"God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen\", popularized in Dickens' \"A Christmas Carol\".\n\nIn Britain, the Christmas tree was introduced in the early 19th century following the personal union with the Kingdom of Hanover by Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, wife of King George III. In 1832, the future Queen Victoria wrote about her delight at having a Christmas tree, hung with lights, ornaments, and presents placed round it. After her marriage to her German cousin Prince Albert, by 1841 the custom became more widespread throughout Britain.\n\nAn image of the British royal family with their Christmas tree at Windsor Castle created a sensation when it was published in the \"Illustrated London News\" in 1848. A modified version of this image was published in the United States in 1850. By the 1870s, putting up a Christmas tree had become common in America.\n\nIn America, interest in Christmas had been revived in the 1820s by several short stories by Washington Irving which appear in his \"The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent.\" and \"Old Christmas\". Irving's stories depicted harmonious warm-hearted English Christmas festivities he experienced while staying in Aston Hall, Birmingham, England, that had largely been abandoned, and he used the tract \"Vindication of Christmas\" (1652) of Old English Christmas traditions, that he had transcribed into his journal as a format for his stories.\n\nIn 1822, Clement Clarke Moore wrote the poem \"A Visit From St. Nicholas\" (popularly known by its first line: \"Twas the Night Before Christmas\").\nThe poem helped popularize the tradition of exchanging gifts, and seasonal Christmas shopping began to assume economic importance.\nThis also started the cultural conflict between the holiday's spiritual significance and its associated commercialism that some see as corrupting the holiday. In her 1850 book \"The First Christmas in New England\", Harriet Beecher Stowe includes a character who complains that the true meaning of Christmas was lost in a shopping spree.\n\nWhile the celebration of Christmas was not yet customary in some regions in the U.S., Henry Wadsworth Longfellow detected \"a transition state about Christmas here in New England\" in 1856. \"The old puritan feeling prevents it from being a cheerful, hearty holiday; though every year makes it more so.\"\nIn Reading, Pennsylvania, a newspaper remarked in 1861, \"Even our presbyterian friends who have hitherto steadfastly ignored Christmas—threw open their church doors and assembled in force to celebrate the anniversary of the Savior's birth.\"\n\nThe First Congregational Church of Rockford, Illinois, \"although of genuine Puritan stock\", was 'preparing for a grand Christmas jubilee', a news correspondent reported in 1864. By 1860, fourteen states including several from New England had adopted Christmas as a legal holiday. In 1875, Louis Prang introduced the Christmas card to Americans. He has been called the \"father of the American Christmas card\". On June 28, 1870, Christmas was formally declared a United States federal holiday.\n\nUp to the 1950s, in the UK, many Christmas customs were restricted to the upper classes and better-off families. The mass of the population had not adopted many of the Christmas rituals that later became general. The Christmas tree was rare. Christmas dinner might be beef—certainly not turkey. In their stockings children might get an apple, orange and sweets. Full celebration of a family Christmas with all the trimmings only became widespread with increased prosperity from the 1950s. National papers were published on Christmas Day until 1912. Post was still delivered on Christmas Day until 1961. League football matches continued in Scotland until the 1970s while in England they ceased at the end of the 1950s.\n\nUnder the state atheism of the Soviet Union, after its foundation in 1917, Christmas celebrations—along with other Christian holidays—were prohibited in public. During the 1920s, 30s and 40s, the League of Militant Atheists encouraged school pupils to campaign against Christmas traditions, such as the Christmas tree, as well as other Christian holidays, including Easter; the League established an antireligious holiday to be the 31st of each month as a replacement. At the height of this persecution, in 1929, on Christmas Day, children in Moscow were encouraged to spit on crucifixes as a protest against the holiday. It was not until the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 that the persecution ended and Orthodox Christmas became a state holiday again for the first time in Russia after seven decades.\n\nEuropean History Professor Joseph Perry wrote that likewise, in Nazi Germany, \"because Nazi ideologues saw organized religion as an enemy of the totalitarian state, propagandists sought to deemphasize—or eliminate altogether—the Christian aspects of the holiday\" and that \"Propagandists tirelessly promoted numerous Nazified Christmas songs, which replaced Christian themes with the regime's racial ideologies.\"\n\nAs Christmas celebrations began to be held around the world even outside traditional Christian cultures in the 20th century, some Muslim-majority countries have banned the practice of Christmas, claiming it undermines Islam.\n\nChristmas Day is celebrated as a major festival and public holiday in countries around the world, including many whose populations are mostly non-Christian. In some non-Christian areas, periods of former colonial rule introduced the celebration (e.g. Hong Kong); in others, Christian minorities or foreign cultural influences have led populations to observe the holiday. Countries such as Japan, where Christmas is popular despite there being only a small number of Christians, have adopted many of the secular aspects of Christmas, such as gift-giving, decorations, and Christmas trees.\n\nCountries in which Christmas is not a formal public holiday include Afghanistan, Algeria, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Bhutan, Cambodia, China (excepting Hong Kong and Macao), Comoros, Iran, Israel, Japan, Kuwait, Laos, Libya, Maldives, Mauritania, Mongolia, Morocco, North Korea, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Tajikistan, Thailand, Tunisia, Turkey, Turkmenistan, United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan, Vietnam, and Yemen. Christmas celebrations around the world can vary markedly in form, reflecting differing cultural and national traditions.\n\nAmong countries with a strong Christian tradition, a variety of Christmas celebrations have developed that incorporate regional and local cultures. For Christians, participating in a religious service plays an important part in the recognition of the season. Christmas, along with Easter, is the period of highest annual church attendance. In Catholic countries, people hold religious processions or parades in the days preceding Christmas. In other countries, secular processions or parades featuring Santa Claus and other seasonal figures are often held. Family reunions and the exchange of gifts are a widespread feature of the season. Gift giving takes place on Christmas Day in most countries. Others practice gift giving on December 6, Saint Nicholas Day, and January 6, Epiphany.\n\nThe practice of putting up special decorations at Christmas has a long history. In the 15th century, it was recorded that in London it was the custom at Christmas for every house and all the parish churches to be \"decked with holm, ivy, bays, and whatsoever the season of the year afforded to be green\". The heart-shaped leaves of ivy were said to symbolize the coming to earth of Jesus, while holly was seen as protection against pagans and witches, its thorns and red berries held to represent the Crown of Thorns worn by Jesus at the crucifixion and the blood he shed.\n\nNativity scenes are known from 10th-century Rome. They were popularised by Saint Francis of Asissi from 1223, quickly spreading across Europe. Different types of decorations developed across the Christian world, dependent on local tradition and available resources, and can vary from simple representations of the crib to far more elaborate sets – renowned manger scene traditions include the colourful \"Kraków szopka\" in Poland, which imitate Kraków's historical buildings as settings, the elaborate Italian \"presepi\" (, and ), or the Provençal crèches in southern France, using hand-painted terracotta figurines called \"santons\". In certain parts of the world, notably Sicily, living nativity scenes following the tradition of Saint Francis are a popular alternative to static crèches. The first commercially produced decorations appeared in Germany in the 1860s, inspired by paper chains made by children. In countries where a representation of the Nativity scene is very popular, people are encouraged to compete and create the most original or realistic ones. Within some families, the pieces used to make the representation are considered a valuable family heirloom.\n\nThe traditional colors of Christmas decorations are red, green, and gold. Red symbolizes the blood of Jesus, which was shed in his crucifixion, while green symbolizes eternal life, and in particular the evergreen tree, which does not lose its leaves in the winter, and gold is the first color associated with Christmas, as one of the three gifts of the Magi, symbolizing royalty.\n\nThe Christmas tree is considered by some as Christianisation of pagan tradition and ritual surrounding the Winter Solstice, which included the use of evergreen boughs, and an adaptation of pagan tree worship; according to eighth-century biographer Æddi Stephanus, Saint Boniface (634–709), who was a missionary in Germany, took an axe to an oak tree dedicated to Thor and pointed out a fir tree, which he stated was a more fitting object of reverence because it pointed to heaven and it had a triangular shape, which he said was symbolic of the Trinity. The English language phrase \"Christmas tree\" is first recorded in 1835 and represents an importation from the German language. The modern Christmas tree tradition is believed to have begun in Germany in the 18th century though many argue that Martin Luther began the tradition in the 16th century.\n\nFrom Germany the custom was introduced to Britain, first via Queen Charlotte, wife of George III, and then more successfully by Prince Albert during the reign of Queen Victoria. By 1841 the Christmas tree had become even more widespread throughout Britain. By the 1870s, people in the United States had adopted the custom of putting up a Christmas tree. Christmas trees may be decorated with lights and ornaments.\n\nSince the 19th century, the poinsettia, a native plant from Mexico, has been associated with Christmas. Other popular holiday plants include holly, mistletoe, red amaryllis, and Christmas cactus. Along with a Christmas tree, the interior of a home may be decorated with these plants, along with garlands and evergreen foliage. The display of Christmas villages has also become a tradition in many homes during this season. The outside of houses may be decorated with lights and sometimes with illuminated sleighs, snowmen, and other Christmas figures.\n\nOther traditional decorations include bells, candles, candy canes, stockings, wreaths, and angels. Both the displaying of wreaths and candles in each window are a more traditional Christmas display. The concentric assortment of leaves, usually from an evergreen, make up Christmas wreaths and are designed to prepare Christians for the Advent season. Candles in each window are meant to demonstrate the fact that Christians believe that Jesus Christ is the ultimate light of the world.\n\nChristmas lights and banners may be hung along streets, music played from speakers, and Christmas trees placed in prominent places. It is common in many parts of the world for town squares and consumer shopping areas to sponsor and display decorations. Rolls of brightly colored paper with secular or religious Christmas motifs are manufactured for the purpose of wrapping gifts. In some countries, Christmas decorations are traditionally taken down on Twelfth Night, the evening of January 5.\n\nThe earliest extant specifically Christmas hymns appear in fourth-century Rome. Latin hymns such as \"Veni redemptor gentium\", written by Ambrose, Archbishop of Milan, were austere statements of the theological doctrine of the Incarnation in opposition to Arianism. \"Corde natus ex Parentis\" (\"Of the Father's love begotten\") by the Spanish poet Prudentius (d. 413) is still sung in some churches today.\n\nIn the 9th and 10th centuries, the Christmas \"Sequence\" or \"Prose\" was introduced in North European monasteries, developing under Bernard of Clairvaux into a sequence of rhymed stanzas. In the 12th century the Parisian monk Adam of St. Victor began to derive music from popular songs, introducing something closer to the traditional Christmas carol.\n\nBy the 13th century, in France, Germany, and particularly, Italy, under the influence of Francis of Asissi, a strong tradition of popular Christmas songs in the native language developed. Christmas carols in English first appear in a 1426 work of John Awdlay, a Shropshire chaplain, who lists twenty-five \"caroles of Cristemas\", probably sung by groups of wassailers, who went from house to house.\nThe songs we know specifically as carols were originally communal folk songs sung during celebrations such as \"harvest tide\" as well as Christmas. It was only later that carols began to be sung in church. Traditionally, carols have often been based on medieval chord patterns, and it is this that gives them their uniquely characteristic musical sound. Some carols like \"Personent hodie\", \"Good King Wenceslas\", and \"The Holly and the Ivy\" can be traced directly back to the Middle Ages. They are among the oldest musical compositions still regularly sung. \"Adeste Fideles\" (O Come all ye faithful) appears in its current form in the mid-18th century, although the words may have originated in the 13th century.\n\nSinging of carols initially suffered a decline in popularity after the Protestant Reformation in northern Europe, although some Reformers, like Martin Luther, wrote carols and encouraged their use in worship. Carols largely survived in rural communities until the revival of interest in popular songs in the 19th century. The 18th-century English reformer Charles Wesley understood the importance of music to worship. In addition to setting many psalms to melodies, which were influential in the Great Awakening in the United States, he wrote texts for at least three Christmas carols. The best known was originally entitled \"Hark! How All the Welkin Rings\", later renamed \"Hark! the Herald Angels Sing\".\nFelix Mendelssohn wrote a melody adapted to fit Wesley's words. In Austria in 1818 Mohr and Gruber made a major addition to the genre when they composed \"Silent Night\" for the St. Nicholas Church, Oberndorf. William Sandys' \"Christmas Carols Ancient and Modern\" (1833) contained the first appearance in print of many now-classic English carols, and contributed to the mid-Victorian revival of the festival.\n\nCompletely secular Christmas seasonal songs emerged in the late 18th century. \"Deck the Halls\" dates from 1784, and the American \"Jingle Bells\" was copyrighted in 1857. In the 19th and 20th century, African American spirituals and songs about Christmas, based in their tradition of spirituals, became more widely known. An increasing number of seasonal holidays songs were commercially produced in the 20th century, including jazz and blues variations. In addition, there was a revival of interest in early music, from groups singing folk music, such as The Revels, to performers of early medieval and classical music.\n\nA special Christmas family meal is traditionally an important part of the holiday's celebration, and the food that is served varies greatly from country to country. Some regions, such as Sicily, have special meals for Christmas Eve, when 12 kinds of fish are served. In the United Kingdom and countries influenced by its traditions, a standard Christmas meal includes turkey, goose or other large bird, gravy, potatoes, vegetables, sometimes bread and cider. Special desserts are also prepared, such as Christmas pudding, mince pies, fruit cake and Yule log cake.\n\nIn Poland and other parts of eastern Europe and Scandinavia, fish often is used for the traditional main course, but richer meat such as lamb is increasingly served. In Sweden it is common with a special variety of smörgåsbord, where ham, meatballs and herring play a prominent role. In Germany, France, and Austria, goose and pork are favored. Beef, ham, and chicken in various recipes are popular throughout the world. The Maltese traditionally serve \"Imbuljuta tal-Qastan\", a chocolate and chestnuts beverage, after Midnight Mass and throughout the Christmas season. Slovaks prepare the traditional Christmas bread potica, \"bûche de Noël\" in France, \"panettone\" in Italy, and elaborate tarts and cakes. The eating of sweets and chocolates has become popular worldwide, and sweeter Christmas delicacies include the German \"stollen\", marzipan cake or candy, and Jamaican rum fruit cake. As one of the few fruits traditionally available to northern countries in winter, oranges have been long associated with special Christmas foods. Eggnog is a sweetened dairy-based beverage traditionally made with milk, cream, sugar, and whipped eggs (which gives it a frothy texture). Spirits such as brandy, rum or bourbon are often added. The finished serving is often garnished with a sprinkling of ground cinnamon or nutmeg.\n\nChristmas cards are illustrated messages of greeting exchanged between friends and family members during the weeks preceding Christmas Day. The traditional greeting reads \"wishing you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year\", much like that of the first commercial Christmas card, produced by Sir Henry Cole in London in 1843. The custom of sending them has become popular among a wide cross-section of people with the emergence of the modern trend towards exchanging E-cards.\n\nChristmas cards are purchased in considerable quantities, and feature artwork, commercially designed and relevant to the season. The content of the design might relate directly to the Christmas narrative, with depictions of the Nativity of Jesus, or Christian symbols such as the Star of Bethlehem, or a white dove, which can represent both the Holy Spirit and Peace on Earth. Other Christmas cards are more secular and can depict Christmas traditions, mythical figures such as Santa Claus, objects directly associated with Christmas such as candles, holly and baubles, or a variety of images associated with the season, such as Christmastide activities, snow scenes and the wildlife of the northern winter. There are even humorous cards and genres depicting nostalgic scenes of the past such as crinolined shoppers in idealized 19th-century streetscapes.\n\nSome prefer cards with a poem, prayer, or Biblical verse; while others distance themselves from religion with an all-inclusive \"Season's greetings\".\n\nA number of nations have issued commemorative stamps at Christmastide. Postal customers will often use these stamps to mail Christmas cards, and they are popular with philatelists. These stamps are regular postage stamps, unlike Christmas seals, and are valid for postage year-round. They usually go on sale some time between early October and early December, and are printed in considerable quantities.\n\nIn 1898 a Canadian stamp was issued to mark the inauguration of the Imperial Penny Postage rate. The stamp features a map of the globe and bears an inscription \"XMAS 1898\" at the bottom. In 1937, Austria issued two \"Christmas greeting stamps\" featuring a rose and the signs of the zodiac. In 1939, Brazil issued four semi-postal stamps with designs featuring the three kings and a star of Bethlehem, an angel and child, the Southern Cross and a child, and a mother and child.\n\nBoth the US Postal Service and the United Kingdom's Royal Mail regularly issue Christmas-themed stamps each year.\n\nThe exchanging of gifts is one of the core aspects of the modern Christmas celebration, making it the most profitable time of year for retailers and businesses throughout the world. On Christmas, people exchange gifts based on the Christian tradition associated with Saint Nicholas, and the gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh which were given to the baby Jesus by the Magi. The practice of gift giving in the Roman celebration of Saturnalia may have influenced Christian Christian customs, but on the other hand the Christian \"core dogma of the Incarnation, however, solidly established the giving and receiving of gifts as the structural principle of that recurrent yet unique event\", because it was the Biblical Magi, \"together with all their fellow men, who received the gift of God through man's renewed participation in the divine life.\"\n\nA number of figures are associated with Christmas and the seasonal giving of gifts. Among these are Father Christmas, also known as Santa Claus (derived from the Dutch for Saint Nicholas), Père Noël, and the Weihnachtsmann; Saint Nicholas or Sinterklaas; the Christkind; Kris Kringle; Joulupukki; tomte; Babbo Natale; Saint Basil; and Ded Moroz. The Scandinavian tomte is sometimes depicted as a gnome instead of Santa Claus.\n\nThe best known of these figures today is red-dressed Santa Claus, of diverse origins. The name Santa Claus can be traced back to the Dutch \"Sinterklaas\", which means simply Saint Nicholas. Nicholas was a 4th-century Greek bishop of Myra, a city in the Roman province of Lycia, whose ruins are from modern Demre in southwest Turkey. Among other saintly attributes, he was noted for the care of children, generosity, and the giving of gifts. His feast day, December 6, came to be celebrated in many countries with the giving of gifts.\n\nSaint Nicholas traditionally appeared in bishop's attire, accompanied by helpers, inquiring about the behaviour of children during the past year before deciding whether they deserved a gift or not. By the 13th century, Saint Nicholas was well known in the Netherlands, and the practice of gift-giving in his name spread to other parts of central and southern Europe. At the Reformation in 16th–17th-century Europe, many Protestants changed the gift bringer to the Christ Child or \"Christkindl\", corrupted in English to Kris Kringle, and the date of giving gifts changed from December 6 to Christmas Eve.\n\nThe modern popular image of Santa Claus, however, was created in the United States, and in particular in New York. The transformation was accomplished with the aid of notable contributors including Washington Irving and the German-American cartoonist Thomas Nast (1840–1902). Following the American Revolutionary War, some of the inhabitants of New York City sought out symbols of the city's non-English past. New York had originally been established as the Dutch colonial town of New Amsterdam and the Dutch Sinterklaas tradition was reinvented as Saint Nicholas.\n\nIn 1809, the New-York Historical Society convened and retroactively named \"Sancte Claus\" the patron saint of Nieuw Amsterdam, the Dutch name for New York City. At his first American appearance in 1810, Santa Claus was drawn in bishops' robes. However, as new artists took over, Santa Claus developed more secular attire. Nast drew a new image of \"Santa Claus\" annually, beginning in 1863. By the 1880s, Nast's Santa had evolved into the modern vision of the figure, perhaps based on the English figure of Father Christmas. The image was standardized by advertisers in the 1920s and continues through the present day.\n\nFather Christmas, a jolly, stout, bearded man who typified the spirit of good cheer at Christmas, predates the Santa Claus character. He is first recorded in early 17th century England, but was associated with holiday merrymaking and drunkenness rather than the bringing of gifts. In Victorian Britain, his image was remade to match that of Santa. The French Père Noël evolved along similar lines, eventually adopting the Santa image. In Italy, Babbo Natale acts as Santa Claus, while La Befana is the bringer of gifts and arrives on the eve of the Epiphany. It is said that La Befana set out to bring the baby Jesus gifts, but got lost along the way. Now, she brings gifts to all children. In some cultures Santa Claus is accompanied by Knecht Ruprecht, or Black Peter. In other versions, elves make the toys. His wife is referred to as Mrs. Claus.\nThere has been some opposition to the narrative of the American evolution of Saint Nicholas into the modern Santa. It has been claimed that the Saint Nicholas Society was not founded until 1835, almost half a century after the end of the American War of Independence. Moreover, a study of the \"children's books, periodicals and journals\" of New Amsterdam by Charles Jones revealed no references to Saint Nicholas or Sinterklaas. However, not all scholars agree with Jones's findings, which he reiterated in a book-length study in 1978; Howard G. Hageman, of New Brunswick Theological Seminary, maintains that the tradition of celebrating Sinterklaas in New York was alive and well from the early settlement of the Hudson Valley on.\n\nCurrent tradition in several Latin American countries (such as Venezuela and Colombia) holds that while Santa makes the toys, he then gives them to the Baby Jesus, who is the one who actually delivers them to the children's homes, a reconciliation between traditional religious beliefs and the iconography of Santa Claus imported from the United States.\n\nIn South Tyrol (Italy), Austria, Czech Republic, Southern Germany, Hungary, Liechtenstein, Slovakia, and Switzerland, the Christkind (Ježíšek in Czech, Jézuska in Hungarian and Ježiško in Slovak) brings the presents. Greek children get their presents from Saint Basil on New Year's Eve, the eve of that saint's liturgical feast. The German St. Nikolaus is not identical with the Weihnachtsmann (who is the German version of Santa Claus / Father Christmas). St. Nikolaus wears a bishop's dress and still brings small gifts (usually candies, nuts, and fruits) on December 6 and is accompanied by Knecht Ruprecht. Although many parents around the world routinely teach their children about Santa Claus and other gift bringers, some have come to reject this practice, considering it deceptive.\n\nSome jurisdictions of the Eastern Orthodox Church, including those of Russia, Georgia, Ukraine, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, and Jerusalem, mark feasts using the older Julian calendar. As of , there is a difference of 13 days between the Julian calendar and the modern Gregorian calendar, which is used internationally for most secular purposes. As a result, December 25 on the Julian calendar currently corresponds to January 7 on the calendar used by most governments and people in everyday life. Therefore, the aforementioned Orthodox Christians mark December 25 (and thus Christmas) on the day that is internationally considered to be January 7.\n\nHowever, other Orthodox Christians, such as those belonging to the jurisdictions of Bulgaria, Greece, Romania, Constantinople, Antioch, Alexandria, Albania, Cyprus, Finland, and the Orthodox Church in America, among others, began using the Revised Julian calendar in the early 20th century, which at present corresponds exactly to the Gregorian calendar. Therefore, these Orthodox Christians mark December 25 (and thus Christmas) on the same day that is internationally considered to be December 25, and which is also the date of Christmas among Western Christians.\n\nA further complication is added by the fact that the Armenian Apostolic Church continues the original ancient Eastern Christian practice of celebrating the birth of Christ not as a separate holiday, but on the same day as the celebration of his baptism (Theophany), which is on January 6. This is a public holiday in Armenia, and it is held on the same day that is internationally considered to be January 6, because the Armenian Church in Armenia uses the Gregorian calendar.\n\nHowever, there is also a small Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem, which maintains the traditional Armenian custom of celebrating the birth of Christ on the same day as Theophany (January 6), but uses the \"Julian\" calendar for the determination of that date. As a result, this church celebrates \"Christmas\" (more properly called Theophany) on the day that is considered January 19 on the Gregorian calendar in use by the majority of the world.\n\nIn summary, there are four different dates used by different Christian groups to mark the birth of Christ, given in the table below.\n\nChristmas is typically a peak selling season for retailers in many nations around the world. Sales increase dramatically as people purchase gifts, decorations, and supplies to celebrate. In the U.S., the \"Christmas shopping season\" starts as early as October. In Canada, merchants begin advertising campaigns just before Halloween (October 31), and step up their marketing following Remembrance Day on November 11. In the UK and Ireland, the Christmas shopping season starts from mid-November, around the time when high street Christmas lights are turned on. In the United States, it has been calculated that a quarter of all personal spending takes place during the Christmas/holiday shopping season. Figures from the U.S. Census Bureau reveal that expenditure in department stores nationwide rose from $20.8 billion in November 2004 to $31.9 billion in December 2004, an increase of 54 percent. In other sectors, the pre-Christmas increase in spending was even greater, there being a November–December buying surge of 100 percent in bookstores and 170 percent in jewelry stores. In the same year employment in American retail stores rose from 1.6 million to 1.8 million in the two months leading up to Christmas. Industries completely dependent on Christmas include Christmas cards, of which 1.9 billion are sent in the United States each year, and live Christmas Trees, of which 20.8 million were cut in the U.S. in 2002. In the UK in 2010, up to £8 billion was expected to be spent online at Christmas, approximately a quarter of total retail festive sales.\nIn most Western nations, Christmas Day is the least active day of the year for business and commerce; almost all retail, commercial and institutional businesses are closed, and almost all industries cease activity (more than any other day of the year), whether laws require such or not. In England and Wales, the Christmas Day (Trading) Act 2004 prevents all large shops from trading on Christmas Day. Scotland is currently planning similar legislation. Film studios release many high-budget movies during the holiday season, including Christmas films, fantasy movies or high-tone dramas with high production values to hopes of maximizing the chance of nominations for the Academy Awards.\n\nOne economist's analysis calculates that, despite increased overall spending, Christmas is a deadweight loss under orthodox microeconomic theory, because of the effect of gift-giving. This loss is calculated as the difference between what the gift giver spent on the item and what the gift receiver would have paid for the item. It is estimated that in 2001, Christmas resulted in a $4 billion deadweight loss in the U.S. alone. Because of complicating factors, this analysis is sometimes used to discuss possible flaws in current microeconomic theory. Other deadweight losses include the effects of Christmas on the environment and the fact that material gifts are often perceived as white elephants, imposing cost for upkeep and storage and contributing to clutter.\n\nChristmas has at times been the subject of controversy and attacks from various sources. Historically it was prohibited by Puritans when they briefly held power in England during the English Interregnum (1649–1660), and in Colonial America where the Puritans outlawed the celebration of Christmas in 1659. The Parliament of Scotland, which was dominated by Presbyterians, passed a series of acts outlawing the observance of Christmas between 1637 and 1690; Christmas Day did not become a public holiday in Scotland until 1958. Christmas celebrations have also been prohibited by atheist states such as the Soviet Union and more recently majority Muslim states such as Somalia, Tajikistan and Brunei.\n\nModern scholars such as E. P. Sanders, Geza Vermes and Marcus Borg consider both Gospel narratives of the birth of Jesus to be non-historical, arguing that there are contradictions between them. Many biblical scholars view the discussion of historicity as secondary, given that gospels were primarily written as theological documents rather than historical accounts.\n\nSome Christians and organizations such as Pat Robertson's American Center for Law and Justice cite alleged attacks on Christmas (dubbing them a \"war on Christmas\"). Such groups claim that any specific mention of the term \"Christmas\" or its religious aspects is being increasingly censored, avoided, or discouraged by a number of advertisers, retailers, government (prominently schools), and other public and private organizations. One controversy is the occurrence of Christmas trees being renamed Holiday trees. In the U.S. there has been a tendency to replace the greeting \"Merry Christmas\" with \"Happy Holidays\", which is considered inclusive at the time of the Jewish celebration of Hanukkah. In the U.S. and Canada, where the use of the term \"Holidays\" is most prevalent, opponents have denounced its usage and avoidance of using the term \"Christmas\" as being politically correct. Groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union have initiated court cases to bar the display of images and other material referring to Christmas from public property, including schools. Such groups argue that government-funded displays of Christmas imagery and traditions violate the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, which prohibits the establishment by Congress of a national religion. In 1984, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in \"Lynch v. Donnelly\" that a Christmas display (which included a Nativity scene) owned and displayed by the city of Pawtucket, Rhode Island, did not violate the First Amendment. In November 2009, the federal appeals court in Philadelphia upheld a school district's ban on the singing of Christmas carols. The Supreme Court of the United States declined to hear an appeal.\n\nAmerican Muslim scholar Abdul Malik Mujahid has said that Muslims must treat Christmas with respect, even if they disagree with it.\n\n\n\n<categorytree depth=0>Public holidays by country</categorytree>\n"}

Contractive maps are sometimes called Lipschitzian maps. If the above condition is instead satisfied for\n\"k\" ≤ 1, then the mapping is said to be a non-expansive map.\n\nMore generally, the idea of a contractive mapping can be defined for maps between metric spaces. Thus, if (\"M\",\"d\") and (\"N\",\"d\"') are two metric spaces, and formula_3, then there is a constant formula_4 such that\nfor all \"x\" and \"y\" in \"M\".\n\nEvery contraction mapping is Lipschitz continuous and hence uniformly continuous (for a Lipschitz continuous function, the constant \"k\" is no longer necessarily less than 1).\n\nA contraction mapping has at most one fixed point. Moreover, the Banach fixed point theorem states that every contraction mapping on a nonempty complete metric space has a unique fixed point, and that for any \"x\" in \"M\" the iterated function sequence \"x\", \"f\" (\"x\"), \"f\" (\"f\" (\"x\")), \"f\" (\"f\" (\"f\" (\"x\"))), ... converges to the fixed point. This concept is very useful for iterated function systems where contraction mappings are often used. Banach's fixed point theorem is also applied in proving the existence of solutions of ordinary differential equations, and is used in one proof of the inverse function theorem.\n\nContraction mapping plays an important role in dynamic programming problems.\n\nA non-expansive mapping with formula_6 can be strengthened to a firmly non-expansive mapping in a Hilbert space \"H\" if the following holds for all \"x\" and \"y\" in \"H\":\nwhere\n\nThis is a special case of formula_9 averaged nonexpansive operators with formula_10.

These electron pairs are known as shared pairs or bonding pairs, and the stable balance of attractive and repulsive forces between atoms, when they share electrons, is known as covalent bonding. For many molecules, the sharing of electrons allows each atom to attain the equivalent of a full outer shell, corresponding to a stable electronic configuration.\n\nCovalent bonding includes many kinds of interactions, including σ-bonding, π-bonding, metal-to-metal bonding, agostic interactions, bent bonds, and three-center two-electron bonds. The term \"covalent bond\" dates from 1939. The prefix \"co-\" means \"jointly, associated in action, partnered to a lesser degree, \" etc.; thus a \"co-valent bond\", in essence, means that the atoms share \"valence\", such as is discussed in valence bond theory.\n\nIn the molecule , the hydrogen atoms share the two electrons via covalent bonding. Covalency is greatest between atoms of similar electronegativities. Thus, covalent bonding does not necessarily require that the two atoms be of the same elements, only that they be of comparable electronegativity. Covalent bonding that entails sharing of electrons over more than two atoms is said to be delocalized.\n\nThe term \"covalence\" in regard to bonding was first used in 1919 by Irving Langmuir in a \"Journal of the American Chemical Society\" article entitled \"The Arrangement of Electrons in Atoms and Molecules\". Langmuir wrote that \"we shall denote by the term \"covalence\" the number of pairs of electrons that a given atom shares with its neighbors.\"\n\nThe idea of covalent bonding can be traced several years before 1919 to Gilbert N. Lewis, who in 1916 described the sharing of electron pairs between atoms. He introduced the \"Lewis notation\" or \"electron dot notation\" or \"Lewis dot structure\", in which valence electrons (those in the outer shell) are represented as dots around the atomic symbols. Pairs of electrons located between atoms represent covalent bonds. Multiple pairs represent multiple bonds, such as double bonds and triple bonds. An alternative form of representation, not shown here, has bond-forming electron pairs represented as solid lines.\n\nLewis proposed that an atom forms enough covalent bonds to form a full (or closed) outer electron shell. In the diagram of methane shown here, the carbon atom has a valence of four and is, therefore, surrounded by eight electrons (the octet rule), four from the carbon itself and four from the hydrogens bonded to it. Each hydrogen has a valence of one and is surrounded by two electrons (a duet rule) – its own one electron plus one from the carbon. The numbers of electrons correspond to full shells in the quantum theory of the atom; the outer shell of a carbon atom is the \"n\" = 2 shell, which can hold eight electrons, whereas the outer (and only) shell of a hydrogen atom is the \"n\" = 1 shell, which can hold only two.\n\nWhile the idea of shared electron pairs provides an effective qualitative picture of covalent bonding, quantum mechanics is needed to understand the nature of these bonds and predict the structures and properties of simple molecules. Walter Heitler and Fritz London are credited with the first successful quantum mechanical explanation of a chemical bond (molecular hydrogen) in 1927. Their work was based on the valence bond model, which assumes that a chemical bond is formed when there is good overlap between the atomic orbitals of participating atoms.\n\nAtomic orbitals (except for s orbitals) have specific directional properties leading to different types of covalent bonds. Sigma (σ) bonds are the strongest covalent bonds and are due to head-on overlapping of orbitals on two different atoms. A single bond is usually a σ bond. Pi (π) bonds are weaker and are due to lateral overlap between p (or d) orbitals. A double bond between two given atoms consists of one σ and one π bond, and a triple bond is one σ and two π bonds.\n\nCovalent bonds are also affected by the electronegativity of the connected atoms which determines the chemical polarity of the bond. Two atoms with equal electronegativity will make nonpolar covalent bonds such as H–H. An unequal relationship creates a polar covalent bond such as with H−Cl. However polarity also requires geometric asymmetry, or else dipoles may cancel out resulting in a non-polar molecule.\n\nThere are several types of structures for covalent substances, including individual molecules, molecular structures, macromolecular structures and giant covalent structures. Individual molecules have strong bonds that hold the atoms together, but there are negligible forces of attraction between molecules. Such covalent substances are usually gases, for example, HCl, SO, CO, and CH. In molecular structures, there are weak forces of attraction. Such covalent substances are low-boiling-temperature liquids (such as ethanol), and low-melting-temperature solids (such as iodine and solid CO). Macromolecular structures have large numbers of atoms linked by covalent bonds in chains, including synthetic polymers such as polyethylene and nylon, and biopolymers such as proteins and starch. Network covalent structures (or giant covalent structures) contain large numbers of atoms linked in sheets (such as graphite), or 3-dimensional structures (such as diamond and quartz). These substances have high melting and boiling points, are frequently brittle, and tend to have high electrical resistivity. Elements that have high electronegativity, and the ability to form three or four electron pair bonds, often form such large macromolecular structures.\n\nBonds with one or three electrons can be found in radical species, which have an odd number of electrons. The simplest example of a 1-electron bond is found in the dihydrogen cation, . One-electron bonds often have about half the bond energy of a 2-electron bond, and are therefore called \"half bonds\". However, there are exceptions: in the case of dilithium, the bond is actually stronger for the 1-electron than for the 2-electron Li. This exception can be explained in terms of hybridization and inner-shell effects.\nThe simplest example of three-electron bonding can be found in the helium dimer cation, . It is considered a \"half bond\" because it consists of only one shared electron (rather than two); in molecular orbital terms, the third electron is in an anti-bonding orbital which cancels out half of the bond formed by the other two electrons. Another example of a molecule containing a 3-electron bond, in addition to two 2-electron bonds, is nitric oxide, NO. The oxygen molecule, O can also be regarded as having two 3-electron bonds and one 2-electron bond, which accounts for its paramagnetism and its formal bond order of 2. Chlorine dioxide and its heavier analogues bromine dioxide and iodine dioxide also contain three-electron bonds.\n\nMolecules with odd-electron bonds are usually highly reactive. These types of bond are only stable between atoms with similar electronegativities.\n\nThere are situations whereby a single Lewis structure is insufficient to explain the electron configuration in a molecule, hence a superposition of structures are needed. The same two atoms in such molecules can be bonded differently in different structures (a single bond in one, a double bond in another, or even none at all), resulting in a non-integer bond order. The nitrate ion is one such example with three equivalent structures. The bond between the nitrogen and each oxygen is a double bond in one structure and a single bond in the other two, so that the average bond order for each N–O interaction is = .\n\nIn organic chemistry, when a molecule with a planar ring obeys Hückel's rule, where the number of π electrons fit the formula 4\"n\" + 2 (where \"n\" is an integer), it attains extra stability and symmetry. In benzene, the prototypical aromatic compound, there are 6 π bonding electrons (\"n\" = 1, 4\"n\" + 2 = 6). These occupy three delocalized π molecular orbitals (molecular orbital theory) or form conjugate π bonds in two resonance structures that linearly combine (valence bond theory), creating a regular hexagon exhibiting a greater stabilization than the hypothetical 1,3,5-cyclohexatriene.\n\nIn the case of heterocyclic aromatics and substituted benzenes, the electronegativity differences between different parts of the ring may dominate the chemical behaviour of aromatic ring bonds, which otherwise are equivalent.\n\nCertain molecules such as xenon difluoride and sulfur hexafluoride have higher co-ordination numbers than would be possible due to strictly covalent bonding according to the octet rule. This is explained by the three-center four-electron bond (\"3c–4e\") model which interprets the molecular wavefunction in terms of non-bonding highest occupied molecular orbitals in molecular orbital theory and ionic-covalent resonance in valence bond theory.\n\nIn three-center two-electron bonds (\"3c–2e\") three atoms share two electrons in bonding. This type of bonding occurs in electron deficient compounds like diborane. Each such bond (2 per molecule in diborane) contains a pair of electrons which connect the boron atoms to each other in a banana shape, with a proton (nucleus of a hydrogen atom) in the middle of the bond, sharing electrons with both boron atoms. In certain cluster compounds, so-called four-center two-electron bonds also have been postulated.\n\nAfter the development of quantum mechanics, two basic theories were proposed to provide a quantum description of chemical bonding: valence bond (VB) theory and molecular orbital (MO) theory. A more recent quantum description is given in terms of atomic contributions to the electronic density of states.\n\nIn COOP, COHP and BCOOP, evaluation of bond covalency is dependent on the basis set. To overcome this issue, an alternative formulation of the bond covalency can be provided in this way.\n\nThe center mass of an atomic orbital ,\nwith quantum numbers , for atom A is defined as\n\nwhere is the contribution of the atomic orbital of the atom A to the total electronic density of states of the solid\n\nwhere the outer sum runs over all atoms A of the unit cell. The energy window is chosen in such a way that it encompasses all relevant bands participating in the bond. If the range to select is unclear, it can be identified in practice by examining the molecular orbitals that describe the electron density along the considered bond.\n\nThe relative position of the center mass of levels of atom A with respect to the center mass of levels of atom B is given as\n\nwhere the contributions of the magnetic and spin quantum numbers are summed. According to this definition, the relative position of the A levels with respect to the B levels is\n\nwhere, for simplicity, we may omit the dependence from the principal quantum number in the notation referring to .\n\nIn this formalism, the greater the value of , the higher the overlap of the selected atomic bands, and thus the electron density described by those orbitals gives a more covalent A–B bond. The quantity is denoted as the \"covalency\" of the A–B bond, which is specified in the same units of the energy .\n\n\n"}

Linear polymers are created using monomers with two reactive end groups and monomers with more than two end groups give three-dimensional polymers which are cross linked.\n\nDehydration synthesis often involves joining monomers with an -OH (hydroxyl) group and a freely ionized -H on either end (such as a hydrogen from the -NH in nylon or proteins). Normally, two or more different monomers are used in the reaction. The bonds between the hydroxyl group, the hydrogen atom and their respective atoms break forming water from the hydroxyl and hydrogen, and the polymer.Actually in this process two water molecules are released.As given below (n+n=2n) \n\nPolyester is created through ester linkages between monomers, which involve the functional groups carboxyl and hydroxyl (an organic acid and an alcohol monomer).\n\nNylon is another common condensation polymer. It can be manufactured by reacting di-amines with carboxyl derivatives. In this example the derivative is a di-carboxylic acid, but di-acyl chlorides are also used. Another approach used is the reaction of di-functional monomers, with one amine and one carboxylic acid group on the same molecule:\n\nThe carboxylic acids and amines link to form peptide bonds, also known as amide groups. Proteins are condensation polymers made from amino acid monomers. Carbohydrates are also condensation polymers made from sugar monomers such as glucose (i.e. cellulose or glycogen) and galactose.\n\nCondensation polymerization is occasionally used to form simple hydrocarbons. This method, however, is expensive and inefficient, so the addition polymer of ethene (polyethylene) is generally used.\n\nCondensation polymers, unlike addition polymers, may be biodegradable. The peptide or ester bonds between monomers can be hydrolysed by acid catalysts or bacterial enzymes breaking the polymer chain into smaller pieces.\n\nThe most commonly known condensation polymers are proteins, fabrics such as nylon, silk, or polyester.\n\n\nPolymers (and condensation polymers) - Virtual Text of Organic Chemistry, William Reusch\n"}

Colorado Springs is located in the east central portion of the state. It is situated on Fountain Creek and is located south of the Colorado State Capitol in Denver.\n\nAt the city stands over above sea level, though some areas of the city are significantly higher and lower. Colorado Springs is situated near the base of one of the most famous American mountains, Pikes Peak, rising above on the eastern edge of the Southern Rocky Mountains. The city is home to 24 national governing bodies of sport, the United States Olympic Committee and the United States Olympic Training Center.\n\nThe city had an estimated population of 465,101 in 2016,<ref name=\"http://quickfacts.census.gov/\"> United States Census Bureau. Accessed May 28, 2014.</ref> ranking as the second most populous city in the state of Colorado, behind Denver, and the 40th most populous city in the United States. The Colorado Springs, CO Metropolitan Statistical Area had an estimated population of 712,327 in 2016. The city is included in the Front Range Urban Corridor, an oblong region of urban population along the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado and Wyoming, generally following the path of Interstate 25 in both states.\n\nThe city covers , making it the most extensive municipality in Colorado. \nThe Ute, Arapaho and Cheyenne peoples were the first to inhabit the area which would become Colorado Springs. Part of the territory included in the United States' 1803 Louisiana Purchase, the current city area was designated part of the 1854 Kansas Territory. In 1859, after the first local settlement was established, it became part of the Jefferson Territory on October24 and of El Paso County on November28. Colorado City at the Front Range confluence of Fountain and Camp creeks was \"formally organized on August13, 1859\" during the Pike's Peak Gold Rush. It served as the capital of the Colorado Territory from November5, 1861, until August14, 1862, when the capital was moved to Denver.\nIn 1871 the Colorado Springs Company laid out the towns of La Font (later called Manitou Springs) and Fountain Colony, upstream and downstream respectively, of Colorado City. Within a year, Fountain Colony would be renamed \"Colorado Springs\", and was officially incorporated. The El Paso County seat shifted from Colorado City in 1873 to the Town of Colorado Springs. On December1, 1880, Colorado Springs expanded northward with two annexations. \nThe second period of annexations was during 188990, and included Seavey's Addition, West Colorado Springs, East End, and another North End addition. In 1891 the Broadmoor Land Company built the Broadmoor suburb, which included the Broadmoor Casino, and by December12, 1895, the city had \"four Mining Exchanges and 275 mining brokers.\" By 1898, the city was designated into quadrants by the north-south Cascade Avenue and the east-west Washington/Pike's Peak avenues.\n\nFrom 1899 to 1901 Tesla Experimental Station operated on Knob Hill, and aircraft flights to the Broadmoor's neighboring fields began in 1919. Alexander Airport north of the city opened in 1925, and in 1927 the original Colorado Springs Municipal Airport land was purchased east of the city.\nIn World War II the United States Army Air Forces leased land adjacent to the municipal airfield, naming it \"Peterson Field\" in December 1942. This was only one of several military presences in and around Colorado Springs during the war.\n\nIn November 1950, Ent Air Force Base was selected as the Cold War headquarters for Air Defense Command (ADC). The former WWII Army Air Base, Peterson Field, which had been inactivated at the end of the war, was re-opened in 1951 as a U.S. Air Force base. The 1950s through 1970s saw a continued expansion of the military presence in the area, with the establishment of NORAD's headquarters in the city, as well as the ADCOM headquarters.\n\nBetween 1965 and 1968 the University of Colorado Colorado Springs, Pikes Peak Community College and Colorado Technical University were established in or near the city. In 1977 most of the former Ent AFB became a US Olympic training center. The Libertarian Party was founded within the city in the 1970s.\n\nOn October 1, 1981, the Broadmoor Addition, Cheyenne Canon, Ivywild, Skyway, and Stratton Meadows were annexed after the Colorado Supreme Court \"overturned a district court decision that voided the annexation\". Further annexations expanding the city include the Nielson Addition and Vineyard Commerce Park Annexation in September 2008. \n\nThe city lies in a high desert with the Southern Rocky Mountains to the west, the Palmer Divide to the north, high plains further east, and high desert lands to the south when leaving Fountain and approaching Pueblo.\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.19%, is water.\n\nColorado Springs has many features of a modern urban area, such as parks, bike trails, and urban open-area spaces. However, it is not exempt from problems that typically plague cities that experience tremendous growth, such as overcrowded roads and highways, crime, sprawl, and government budget issues. Many of the problems are indirectly or directly caused by the city's difficulty in coping with the large population growth experienced in the last twenty years, and the annexation of the Banning Lewis Ranch area to accommodate further population growth of 175,000 future residents.\n\nColorado Springs has a semi-arid climate (Köppen \"BSk\"), and its location just east of the Rocky Mountains affords it the rapid warming influence from chinook winds during winter but also subjects it to drastic day-to-day variability in weather conditions. The city has abundant sunshine year-round, averaging 243 sunny days per year, and receives approximately of annual precipitation. Due to unusually low precipitation for several years after flooding in 1999, Colorado Springs enacted lawn water restrictions in 2002. These were lifted in 2005.\n\nColorado Springs is one of the most active lightning strike areas in the United States. This natural phenomenon led Nikola Tesla to select Colorado Springs as the preferred location to build his lab and study electricity.\n\nWinters range from mild to moderately cold, with December, the coldest month, averaging ; historically January has been the coldest month, but, in recent years, December has had both lower daily maxima and minima. Typically, there are 5.2 nights with sub- lows and 23.6 days where the high does not rise above freezing, and extended sub-zero (°F) cold snaps are possible but infrequent.\n\nSnowfall is usually moderate and remains on the ground briefly because of direct sun, with the city receiving per season, although the mountains to the west often receive in excess of triple that amount; March is the snowiest month in the region, both by total accumulation and number of days with measurable snowfall. In addition, 8 of the top 10 heaviest 24-hour snowfalls have occurred from March to May. Summers are warm, with July, the warmest month, averaging , and 18 days of + highs annually. Due to the high elevation and aridity, nights are usually relatively cool and rarely does the low remain above . Dry weather generally prevails, but brief afternoon thunderstorms are common, especially in July and August when the city receives the majority of its annual rainfall, due to the North American Monsoon.\n\nThe first autumn freeze and the last freeze in the spring, on average, occur on October 2 and May 6, respectively; the average window for measurable snowfall (≥) is October 21 through April 25. Extreme temperatures range from on June 26, 2012 and most recently on June 21, 2016, down to on February 1, 1951 and December 9, 1919.\n\nAs of the 2010 census, the population of Colorado Springs was 416,427 (40th most populous U.S. city), and the population of the Colorado Springs Metropolitan Statistical Area was 645,613 in 2010 (84th most populous MSA), and the population of the Front Range Urban Corridor in Colorado was an estimated 4,166,855.\n\nAs of the April 2010 census: 78.8% White, 16.1% Hispanic or Latino (of any race), 6.3% Black or African American, 3.0% Asian, 1.0% Native American, 0.3% Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, \n5.5% Some other race, 5.1% Two or more races. Mexican Americans made up 14.6% of the city's population. The median age in the city was 35 years. Non-Hispanic Whites were 70.7% of the population, compared to 86.6% in 1970.\n\nColorado Springs' economy is driven primarily by the military, the high-tech industry, and tourism, in that order. The city is currently experiencing some growth mainly in the service sectors. The unemployment rate for the city as of October 2015 was 3.9%, a decrease from 4.8% in October 2014 and 7.3% in November 2013 and compared to 3.8% for the state and 5.0% for the nation.\n\nThe defense industry plays a major role in the Colorado Springs economy, with some of the city's largest employers coming from the sector. A large segment of this industry is dedicated to the development and operation of various projects for missile defense. With its close ties to defense, the aerospace industry has also influenced the Colorado Springs economy.\n\nAlthough some defense corporations have left or downsized city campuses, a slight growth trend is still recorded. Significant defense corporations in the city include Boeing, General Dynamics, Harris Corporation, SAIC, ITT, L-3 Communications, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman. The Space Foundation is based in Colorado Springs.\n\nA large percentage of Colorado Springs' economy is based on manufacturing high tech and complex electronic equipment. The high tech sector in the Colorado Springs area has decreased its overall presence from 2000 to 2006 (from around 21,000 down to around 8,000), with notable reductions in information technology and complex electronic equipment. Due to a slowing in tourism, the high tech sector still remains second to the military in terms of total revenue generated and employment. Current trends project the high tech employment ratio will continue to decrease in the near future.\n\nHigh tech corporations with connections to the city include:\n\nVerizon Business, a telecommunications firm, had nearly 1300 employees in 2008. Hewlett-Packard has a large sales, support, and SAN storage engineering center for the computer industry.\n\nStorage Networking Industry Association is the home of the SNIA Technology Center. Agilent, spun off from HP in 1999 as an independent, publicly traded company. Intel had 250 employees in 2009. The facility is now used for the centralized unemployment and social services complex.\n\nBroadcom (formerly LSI Corporation) designs semiconductors and software that accelerate storage and networking in datacenters and mobile networks. Microchip Technology (formerly Atmel), is a chip fabrication organization. Cypress Semiconductor Colorado Design Center is a chip fabrication research and development site. The Apple Inc. facility was sold to Sanmina-SCI in 1996.\n\nThe city's location at the base of Pikes Peak and the Rocky Mountains makes it a popular tourism destination. Tourism is the third largest employer in the Pikes Peak region, accounting for more than 16,000 jobs. Nearly 5 million visitors come to the area annually, contributing $1.35 billion in revenue.\n\nColorado Springs has more than 55 attractions and activities in the area, including Garden of the Gods, United States Air Force Academy, the ANA Money Museum, Cheyenne Mountain Zoo, Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center, Old Colorado City and the U.S. Olympic Training Center.\n\nThe downtown Colorado Springs Visitor Information Center offers free area information to leisure and business travelers. The Cultural Office of the Pikes Peak Region (COPPeR), also located downtown, supports and advocates for the arts throughout the Pikes Peak Region. It operates the PeakRadar website to communicate city events.\n\nAlthough houses of worship of almost every major world religion can be found in the city, Colorado Springs has in particular attracted a large influx of Evangelical Christians and Christian organizations in recent years. At one time Colorado Springs was counted to be the national headquarters for 81 different religious organizations, earning the city the tongue-in-cheek nicknames \"the Evangelical Vatican\" and \"The Christian Mecca.\" Religious groups with regional or international headquarters in Colorado Springs include:\n\nAlthough Colorado voters approved Colorado Amendment 64, a constitutional amendment in 2013 legalizing retail sales of marijuana for recreational purposes, the Colorado Springs city council voted not to permit retail shops in the city, as was allowed in the amendment. Medical marijuana outlets continue to operate in Colorado Springs. As of 2015, there were 91 medical marijuana clinics in the city, which reported sales of $59.6 million in 2014, up 11 percent from the previous year but without recreational marijuana shops. On April 26, 2016 Colorado Springs city council decided to extend the current six-month moratorium to eighteen months with no new licenses to be granted until May 2017.\n\nColorado Springs has been the subject of or setting for many books, movies and television shows, and is a frequent backdrop for political thrillers and military-themed stories because of its many military installations and vital importance to the United States' continental defense. Notable television series using the city as a setting include \"Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman\" and the \"Stargate\" series \"Stargate SG-1\", as well as the films \"WarGames\" and \"The Prestige\".\n\nIn a North Korean propaganda video released in April 2013, Colorado Springs was inexplicably singled out as one of four targets for a missile strike. The video failed to pinpoint Colorado Springs on the map, instead showing a spot somewhere in Louisiana.\n\nThe documentary television series \"Homicide Hunter\", in which former Colorado Springs police detective Joseph Kenda recounts cases of homicide from his career, is set in Colorado Springs.\n\nColorado Springs, dubbed Olympic City USA, is home to the United States Olympic Training Center and the headquarters of the United States Olympic Committee and the United States Anti-Doping Agency. In addition, 24 of the United States' national federations for individual Olympic sports have their headquarters in Colorado Springs, including: US bobsled, fencing, figure skating, basketball, boxing, cycling, judo, field hockey, hockey, swimming, shooting, table tennis, taekwondo, triathlon, volleyball, pentathlon, handball, and wrestling associations and organizations.\n\nFurther, over 50 national sports organizations (non-Olympic) headquarter in Colorado Springs. These include the National Strength and Conditioning Association, Sports Incubator, a various non-Olympic Sports (such as USA Ultimate), and more.\n\nColorado Springs and Denver hosted the 1962 World Ice Hockey Championships.\n\nThe city has a long association with the sport of figure skating, having hosted the U.S. Figure Skating Championships six times and the World Figure Skating Championships five times. It is home to the World Figure Skating Museum and Hall of Fame and the Broadmoor Skating Club, a notable training center for the sport. In recent years, the World Arena has hosted skating events such as Skate America and the Four Continents Figure Skating Championships.\n\nThe Pikes Peak International Hill Climb (PPIHC), also known as The Race to the Clouds, is an annual invitational automobile and motorcycle hill climb to the summit of Pikes Peak, every year on the last Sunday of June. The first running of the Pikes Peak Hill Climb was promoted by Spencer Penrose. Penrose had finished widening the narrow carriage road into a much wider \"Pikes Peak Highway.\" He decided to encourage tourists to visit by creating a race to the clouds.\n\nThe PPIHC takes place on a 12.42 mile (19.99 km) public toll-road boasting 156 turns, while competitors climb 4,720 ft. (1,440 m.) from the 9,390 ft. (2,862 m.) start line at mile 7 marker on the Pikes Peak Highway to the 14,115 ft. (4,300 m) finish line at the summit.\n\nThe race is self-sanctioned and is the most diverse one day motorsports event in the world with everything from Sidecars, Motorcycles, Semi-Trucks, and 1,400+hp EV & Unlimited Racers being able to compete in the same event. The highway wasn't completely paved until 2011.\n\nThe local colleges feature many sports teams. Notable among them are the following nationally competitive NCAA Division I teams: United States Air Force Academy (Falcons) Football, Basketball and Hockey, Colorado College (Tigers) Hockey, and Women's Soccer. Colorado Springs also boasts three top-ranked Division III collegiate ultimate programs: Air Force Afterburn (Open), Colorado College Wasabi (Open), and Colorado College Strata (Women's).\n\nThe Mountain West Conference and the National Collegiate Hockey Conference is based in Colorado Springs.\n\nColorado Springs is home to the Pro Rodeo Hall of Fame and the headquarters of the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association.\n\nColorado Springs was the original headquarters of the Professional Bull Riders (PBR) from its founding in 1992 until 2005, when the organization was moved to Pueblo; the PBR used to hold an annual Built Ford Tough Series event at the World Arena from 2001 until 2005 when the organization made the move to Pueblo.\n\nThere are 136 neighborhood, 8 community, 7 regional parks and 5 sports complexes totaling 9,000 acres managed by the city's Parks, Recreation and Cultural Services. They also manage 500 acres of trails, which are 160 miles of park trails and 105 miles of urban trails. There are 5,000 acres of open spaces in 48 open space areas.\n\nOne of the most popular areas in Colorado Springs is the park on its western edge, Garden of the Gods, considered by many to be the most beautiful park in the world. It is a National Natural Landmark with 300 foot sandstone rock formations often viewed against a backdrop of the snow-capped mountains of Pikes Peak. The park offers a variety of annual events, one of the most popular of which is the Starlight Spectacular; a recreational bike ride held every summer to benefit the Trails and Open Space Coalition of Colorado Springs.\n\nColorado Springs has several major parks, such as Palmer Park, America the Beautiful Park (Confluence Park), Memorial Park, and Monument Valley Park. The Austin Bluffs Park also affords a place of recreation in eastern Colorado Springs. Ponderosa pine (\"Pinus ponderosa\"), Gambel oak (\"Quercus gambelii\"), narrowleaf yucca (\"Yucca angustissima\", syn. \"Yucca glauca\") and prickly pear cactus (\"Opuntia macrorhiza\") are some of the more common flora endemic to the Front Range in Colorado Springs.\n\nThree trails, the New Santa Fe Regional Trail, Pikes Peak Greenway and Fountain Creek Regional Trail, form a continuous path from Palmer Lake, through Colorado Springs, to Fountain, Colorado. The majority of the trail between Palmer Lake and Fountain is a soft surface breeze gravel trail. A major segment of the trail within the Colorado Springs city limits is paved.\n\nThe Urban Trail system \"within Colorado Springs\" consists of more than 110 miles of multi-use trail for biking, jogging, roller blading and walking.\n\nThe trails, except Monument Valley Park trails, may be used for equestrian traffic. Motorized vehicles are not allowed on the trails. Many of the trails are interconnected, having main \"spine\" trails, like the Pikes Peak Greenway, that lead to secondary trails.\n\nOn November 2, 2010, Colorado Springs voters adopted a council-strong mayor form of government. The City of Colorado Springs transitioned to the new system of government in 2011. Under the council-strong mayor system of government, the mayor is the chief executive and the city council is the legislative branch. The mayor is a full-time elected position and not a member of the city council. The city council has nine members total, six of which represent one of six equally populated districts each. The remaining three members are elected \"at-large\". The mayor has veto authority, with the city council having the ability to override a mayoral veto by a two-thirds majority vote (6 out of 9).\n\nColorado Springs City Hall was built from 1902 to 1904 on land donated by W.
